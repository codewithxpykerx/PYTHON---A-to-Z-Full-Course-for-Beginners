1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:08,360
So well what I sent into orbit is actually assignment operators saw use it to assign land use to variables

2
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:14,330
and the different types of assignment values are in the world.

3
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:15,960
Let's see what minus equals.

4
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:20,390
And so on until the one because in the past.

5
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,110
OK.

6
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:32,300
OK let's try these examples.

7
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,480
5.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,980
So we have assigned a variable.

9
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:47,100
I mean we are assigned a value or find a variable.

10
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:50,390
You don't get reading variable you and assign a value to.

11
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:53,650
So these are all the more assigned values.

12
00:00:53,990 --> 00:01:00,440
Now let's check what is meant by place equal to nothing but it adds the right side value to the left

13
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,650
side value and its end result will be the left side right.

14
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:08,050
OK let's see an example.

15
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:12,840
Yea plus equal to 2.

16
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:15,140
So the result will be 7.

17
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:18,170
That's pretty.

18
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:26,670
So hold the pipe help right in a calculator that yea less equal to 2.

19
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:35,620
Yes insanity was to using that again because to take one to endless two.

20
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:37,030
So this was.

21
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:42,740
So this statement was actually called A's goal is to luck in short.

22
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:49,710
By then I'll be able to modify Python in this manner.

23
00:01:50,300 --> 00:02:01,710
Let's take that easy call to center is equal to bless to your best to win it.

24
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,240
So.

25
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,020
So this was an book.

26
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,600
So this is all about equal.

27
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:10,670
And similarly with minus equal if he is equal to four

28
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:15,580
a minus equal to 1.

29
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:23,770
So this is equal to easy called eight minus one seems easy call for is equal to four minus 1 which is

30
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:28,140
nothing but 3:28 that's all.

31
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:33,250
And that's all with the multiplication and of the division.

32
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:45,370
I'll If you want example let's take an example and equality for each division equal to two Donta should

33
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:46,950
be two.

34
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:53,080
Which is nothing but full by two is nothing but a by two.

35
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:57,060
And he would

36
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:04,480
next be easy called Musical 3

37
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,740
according to.

38
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:14,970
So he agreed to do it because it's been beat.

39
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:16,340
OK.

40
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:23,470
And now the modulus more as we have discussed just now the more or less is nothing but a reminder of

41
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,750
the division operation.

42
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:31,670
OK let's initialize another bailable call see is equal to

43
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:46,320
level see modulars see more or less equal to two Donalson began.

44
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:55,190
I mean if you divide by two the are the minder was one actually plug in C.

45
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,180
So they might be one.

46
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:58,050
OK.

47
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,750
Now the last one was exponential

48
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,260
less easily available.

49
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,010
Is equality.

50
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:11,620
And let's try to take the bar of 4 which is now which is nothing by 80 were

51
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:21,320
equal to 4 3 in the.

52
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:24,000
Yes that's right.

53
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:25,420
OK.

54
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:28,000
Now we have got one assignment up us.

55
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:32,220
Let's dig into our big ways operators.
