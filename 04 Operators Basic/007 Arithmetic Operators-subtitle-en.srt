1
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:08,930
First of four wheel drive alone learn Dometic overtake us.

2
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:15,670
So what are the operators and the medical operators are used to both from domestic operations like addition

3
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:20,170
subtraction multiplication division modulus Xplornet.

4
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:24,760
So let's begin to integrate anti-GPL from some examples.

5
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:25,930
Let's open them to bigger

6
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:33,760
worked like that.

7
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:34,100
All right.

8
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:36,240
So we are going to repeat or not.

9
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:42,560
So instead of this python interpreter Let's enter to interact by the interpreter.

10
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:52,460
So our indirect indirectly by the interpreter and interpreter are seen by indirect do in the middle

11
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:56,250
is nothing but a normal bike that in the corridor with Stylites on it.

12
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:03,900
I mean it has the various new functionalities and attributes except rest of the user base for a minute.

13
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:07,050
So let's end when do interactive by an interpreter.

14
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:12,690
Basically for non-bird don't really really build realtime just by them.

15
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:21,920
But in a body in case of fire indirect to individuals we need to use AI AI before it might work.

16
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:24,740
So this is nothing but interactive fiction.

17
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:33,500
All right so we are into or biting into a bit and let us know what the operators are trying to declared

18
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:39,050
to values with some are by assigning values to it.

19
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:42,410
I mean I could get two variables by assigning some ballastic

20
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:47,650
equal nine

21
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:55,180
Beag equal to yet both from

22
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:58,770
Asian point

23
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:06,380
B.

24
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:07,830
So that's.

25
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:15,760
That's imply that apart from Elisha and in Dubai too when we are using just the word print in order

26
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,960
to bring the value of a variable.

27
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:25,730
But in case of bidon to point Armon byte entry we need to use this statement as a function.

28
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:33,230
I mean Bing has been converted into function by the Dupont's like roundoff Glaspie.

29
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:44,650
When God bless b c so you've been able to print the value of a variable and do this by using print as

30
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:48,090
a statement and print as a function.

31
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,030
All right.

32
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:52,650
So let's also know let's move on some.

33
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:53,430
Ms.

34
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:54,360
Substraction

35
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:58,680
sorry.

36
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,040
B.

37
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:00,820
That's it.

38
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:04,850
Nine minutes is equal to one and as a multiplication.

39
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,310
Let's take some of them.

40
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,440
I mean values by creating some different variants

41
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:16,990
in Python.

42
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:27,230
You can buffer multiplication by using an operator stack.

43
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:29,490
So this was awkward.

44
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:30,970
Now

45
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:36,570
let's get to this division

46
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,080
what so are many.

47
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:52,330
When we divided the divide into Yea by B I mean 4 by 3 million the value is 1.

48
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:55,550
And the next one was Margulis.

49
00:03:55,820 --> 00:04:01,480
So Words mean more to us madrassas is nothing but a reminder of the division operation.

50
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:09,830
For example the Colt 45 Yeezy called Six.

51
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:14,520
And when you type in modulus B.

52
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:17,570
So the output should be three.

53
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:29,090
So we got down to the street when we divided 45 by 6 we mean the actual question was 6 sevens 42 and

54
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:30,080
the remainder was three.

55
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,050
So that was their actual output.

56
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:39,480
If you don't understand that I show you.

57
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:43,940
Six forty five.

58
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:56,020
So so in Division of General mathematics if you divide it 45 by six I mean the value should be 7 6 7

59
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:56,730
42.

60
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:03,160
And that reminder should be easy.

61
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,830
So this was an actual non-idiots you

62
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,260
know exponent.

63
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:15,890
So what is in my experience exponent is nothing but extra for a.

64
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:20,770
Let's also try to give an example for this.

65
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:25,270
Let's take easy calls for an easy called 3.

66
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:28,870
So I can cite for that.

67
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:33,540
Easy for me is equal to three.

68
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:44,140
So how you implement the exponent functionality in PI that simple did that was that B why we declared

69
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:47,970
B's call for B must be 3 OK whatever.

70
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,390
44 or 4 is nothing but Duvel 6.

71
00:05:51,560 --> 00:06:00,790
So this is equal to fall into four into four four.

72
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:08,400
So this was the actual processing behind the exponent functionality.
