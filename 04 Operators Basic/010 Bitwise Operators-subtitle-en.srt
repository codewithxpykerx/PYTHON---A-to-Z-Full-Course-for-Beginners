1
00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:07,440
So what a big place oblateness big boys operate as compass values in binary formats.

2
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:13,610
These operators walk on in distance when performing big boys are and in DS as initially these Indians

3
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:21,050
and ready to buy in any form and then some of them Batjer.

4
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:21,740
All right.

5
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:24,610
So let's begin to pick some examples.

6
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:30,600
And the big leagues operators are.

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:40,740
And this Simmo was all as binary and binary art and binary Zot X or binary compliment.

8
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:46,220
This is nothing but the negation and binary shift and binary shift

9
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:50,720
lips.

10
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:53,200
Let's get to know first about this binary and

11
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,730
let's try to create two variables over here is it.

12
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:12,070
90 is equal to 18 so be initialized and we created two variables with values 19 and 18.

13
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:16,500
Let's call for advice and operators on these two variables.

14
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:19,570
And B.

15
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,780
So the output was 80.

16
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:22,530
How.

17
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:29,310
So in the bag on BIDEN First can we do this 19 engaging Dubai in any form.

18
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:31,950
And then performs and operation.

19
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:36,320
Let's check what is a binary format of 19.

20
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:39,220
How is been able to take that in byte and simple.

21
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:40,720
We have some function.

22
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:48,550
So the binary format of YIG which isn't which is nothing but 19 is 1 0 1 1.

23
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:50,140
Let's also know the binary format of

24
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,590
the binary form of B.

25
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:56,770
OK.

26
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:03,760
Biden compares these to binary formats over here and finds the result in binary divorcement and then

27
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:07,590
it can What's that binary format into India.

28
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:14,820
OK so how we can be is actually how we both homes and Operation Biddy's binary format.

29
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:15,460
OK.

30
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:21,930
In case of an resultant value will be 1 if bought 0 values or 1.

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,120
Ok let's try to understand understand this with an example.

32
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:32,640
Let's copy this.

33
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:44,500
So of byte on both forms the and Operation result in value of 1 and 0.

34
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:55,660
I mean the result in comparison of two digits will be 1 if bought our visits are 1 in guess of an operation.

35
00:02:55,660 --> 00:03:01,820
For example here 1 and 0 1 and 0 should be 0.

36
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:13,450
We've gone from start 1 and 1 is 1 and 0 0 0 0 1 and 0.

37
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,370
So I think it was one action.

38
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:26,290
So the resultant value should be one only if bought combatted in values are what otherwise the value

39
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:26,920
should be zero.

40
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:32,260
For example the board values are what he had the book conversion values he had that one and hence the

41
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:34,290
resulting value was 1 in guess of.

42
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:39,280
And similarly with 1 and 1 is 1 and 1 and 0 since.

43
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:45,830
Would that not once and one is one value 1 and 1 is that is all the result in that it should be zero.

44
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:53,620
So and So initially pikemen got the result by comparing two binary formants of two in these as as this

45
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:53,800
one.

46
00:03:53,800 --> 00:04:01,140
So let's try to find out what was indeed notation of these binary form it's all you can able to find

47
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:07,560
in the format of a binary does it's by using a function called in Python.

48
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,690
Been off this one

49
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:22,700
so it's not been actually Binny's use it to come more to the Indies as in binary formats.

50
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:26,760
If you want to convert the binary pharmaco end in disaster.

51
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:30,160
So you need to use it if until God in desire.

52
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:32,610
Indeed indeed.

53
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:33,240
All right.

54
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,280
So this is a value of 18 actually

55
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:54,380
arrive.

56
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,830
So this is the value of Ailey.

57
00:04:55,830 --> 00:05:02,500
Actually this is similar with our operation in case I forget of course we are.

58
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:08,820
I mean we got to know about an operation and now let us know about this operation so how Python compares

59
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:09,900
to binary formats.

60
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,680
I mean do numbers actually.

61
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:17,270
So for 1998 in these two are the binary formats and byte and initially compares the binary formats and.

62
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,420
And the result will be a binary and this binary will become region doing this at.

63
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,470
So now we got bored and.

64
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:31,530
And let us know what our in case of binary are the result and I mean the result will be one if it is

65
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:33,420
to one of the bits is 1.

66
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,560
For example previously the result will be 1.

67
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:42,500
Only if both values are 1 but in the case of are the result will be the result will be 1.

68
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:46,100
If at least one of these conversion Well this was one.

69
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:46,780
OK.

70
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:51,990
And now the output will be 1 seems at least one of the two.

71
00:05:52,100 --> 00:06:02,370
What else is one the value will be 1 0 since no all values 1 1 0 1 and it just seems at least one of

72
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:05,490
the two converging values is one the value will be 1.

73
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:13,910
So this is a value of art as and now Python can load this binary format to it.

74
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:19,390
So let's check what's so what was the value of it.

75
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:24,050
And our sorry.

76
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:26,530
So the value should be of us here

77
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:34,610
all right so this was all about

78
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,270
binary OR.

79
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:42,930
And what was and what this binary export binary.

80
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,120
OK.

81
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:49,850
More in case of binary X or the result will be one.

82
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:54,650
If it leads to 1 which is one button but not both will be 1.

83
00:06:54,660 --> 00:07:02,850
I mean when when comparing these two values at least one of the values should be what if both the value

84
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:05,560
should be 1 the value should be zero and and essentially busy.

85
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,270
So this is a condition in exo.

86
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:20,280
OK let's deal with it since at least I mean if both should be one the value should be 0 0 0 0 if both

87
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:20,690
are 1.

88
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:24,040
The value should be zero if at least one that should do one.

89
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:28,930
I mean if a list one values one the resultant value should be 1.

90
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:36,880
So this is a binary format in Python by the to end this as 1928 and so what is indeed a representative

91
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,940
representation of this.

92
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:47,860
B is well OK.

93
00:07:48,330 --> 00:08:01,930
Let's check off what.

94
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:08,900
OK so the binary format of 1 was this one.

95
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:20,280
So so now we got to know about binary binary or similarly binary complement in guess on binary content.

96
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:25,430
When you initialize and then with easy called 9.

97
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:32,100
So how you would negate a value is it is nothing but you.

98
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:37,040
So the negation of nine is nothing but 8.

99
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:47,340
And you can also convert this minus 10 to 9 by using and then negation like mightest in negation back

100
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:47,730
to nine.

101
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,930
So this is all about.

102
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,040
By then complement or by the negation.

103
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,480
So what is left.

104
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,080
No we learn about left

105
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:04,520
left is nothing but the left value is moved by Nemeroff bits left.

106
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:10,120
I mean inspired by like I mean the left values more left by the Nemeroff bit specified by like value

107
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:23,710
for example let's take the gold and see what is a binary binary form of it.

108
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:28,920
It's nothing but a double one double zero and one double zero.

109
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:36,000
When we apply live shift operators I mean shift operation on this variable.

110
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,490
Yea let's check what was the result of this

111
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:42,780
too.

112
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:44,030
So what is a binary for.

113
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,870
So the resultant Indesign was what.

114
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:48,070
Let's take the band in the format of this form that

115
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:55,930
so you can able to see that.

116
00:09:55,980 --> 00:10:05,150
Now WWE the one double double one was the one that was it a saw or the value the binary format has moved

117
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:10,050
to its left to reflect back into its right so.

118
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:13,200
So it has more left actually.

119
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:16,540
Now let's take a ball right

120
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,480
next to initialize and available.

121
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:23,870
Right.

122
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:26,780
Let's and right shift operation on these very

123
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:33,360
too.

124
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:35,990
Was that really when you say OK let's take it.

125
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:38,830
So initially we need to check what was a binary representation of B

126
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:44,430
B.

127
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:49,830
Ok so the binary presentation of bit was double and was it a wonder.

128
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:56,730
Let's check and see how I played the blame the right shift operation on this variable be.

129
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:59,290
So the reason that the result was 25.

130
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:02,000
So let's say that by an 80 percent it's not 25.

131
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:08,780
And and and see where that goes by 80 percent in and has been moved Booby's it's right or not

132
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:14,700
would be fine.

133
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:15,950
Yes.

134
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:25,450
So double one double 0 1 these binary digits has me has more Booby's it's right by the leading 0 0 0.

135
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:31,130
We've been able to see the length of this one two three four five six seven and here and here the left

136
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:31,810
was only five.

137
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:35,260
That means he has more to do this right.
