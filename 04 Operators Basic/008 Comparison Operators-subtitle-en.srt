1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,270
Lead and turn into combative you know because.

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:10,140
So what I combatted you know this comparison operators are used to compare the values on both sides

3
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:11,690
of it.

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:14,270
They are also less relational operators.

5
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:15,970
So some of the combat.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,410
I mean the come down Bajan operators are greater than Lizanne does not equal to less than or equal to

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:28,710
equal to not equal to and not equal to going out of business and can also build in the dungeon symbol

8
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,670
monocoque.

9
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:34,730
Let's see an example for this.

10
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:52,850
Easy code 9 to be easy could create looks initially first check and credit that vector is greater than

11
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:56,590
should be true of course 9 is going to end yet.

12
00:00:56,630 --> 00:01:07,160
And also Giclas that is less than be false of course is greater than I mean B and less than 9 and hence

13
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:07,980
is false.

14
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:14,950
Now let's say that equal to it is better than or equal to

15
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:19,800
B.

16
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,480
I'm sorry.

17
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:25,280
We should we should but we shouldn't give any space between those operators.

18
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:27,860
Yes.

19
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:30,130
Listen Michael to me.

20
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:31,600
Of course it is false.

21
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:33,560
And we're losing money on it.

22
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:36,540
Equal to whether one is equal eight.

23
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:37,260
Was that true.

24
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:37,880
Let's go

25
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,120
to please.

26
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,540
Azo here.

27
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:51,290
If you single people do then we are then it indicates that we are assigning a value to anybody.

28
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:57,460
But if you use double equal do it means that we are checking the value of both variables here.

29
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,620
OK so next.

30
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:07,400
Not equal to the is not equal to the two of course it is true.

31
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:14,110
Nine is not equal galiot and not equal to has two symbols.

32
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:18,880
I mean this one and and another one.

33
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:22,990
Let's also check with that.

34
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,140
Yes of course it's true.
