Guys to me we'll try to learn about operators in Python.

2
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:08,230
So what are the operators.

3
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:13,370
Operators are nothing but symbols which will form some processing of data.

4
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,200
I mean people from some data processing.

5
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:20,600
So there are many types of fbregas in Python.

6
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:28,500
Like I have shown here and there are domestic operators combatted integrators assignment operators bitwise

7
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:33,750
operators logical operators membership operators and identify operators.
