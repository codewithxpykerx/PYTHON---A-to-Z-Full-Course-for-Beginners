1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,550
The membership operators and I didn't at it.

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:07,770
So these are the two biggest remaining So let's get to know I bought this membership Albrecht's

3
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:19,370
there are two types of membership oblateness in byte and one is in NRD membership operators are best

4
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:26,450
for the presence of a variable value in a sequence data types for example string list double etc..

5
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:33,180
So the membership are progressing by the not in and not

6
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:40,700
nodded.

7
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:42,370
So let's.

8
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,050
I mean let's know what is in and how it is used.

9
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:48,200
Let's make some simple examples but this

10
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:52,320
is a

11
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,270
reason called

12
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:04,600
Twenty five list never died.

13
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:07,510
This data is called

14
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,810
for it.

15
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,870
So we need to live with it.

16
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:31,160
The game is done right.

17
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:38,000
Of course the value of a variable.

18
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:40,500
Hello we are checking that whether this variable.

19
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:44,020
I mean there is value will exist in this list right.

20
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:47,290
Hello Of course and Antigua's that's true.

21
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:51,010
I simply and also check with Nagi.

22
00:01:51,340 --> 00:02:04,510
Yea nodded Lister and I thought because we have the value of Yate exist in this genotype and hence the

23
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:05,320
results would be true.

24
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:11,300
But we also check that by using not an operator whether or not it is done today.

25
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:13,880
No of course it does and hence the result was FOTS

26
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:24,640
and the last updated and the last operator section in Biden was identity our identity or previous support.

27
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:27,780
I didn't drop anything say in by the yet.

28
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,300
Drama is not so.

29
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:34,860
These are the two I in but does that exist by then as a membership update.

30
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:37,750
So let's see an example for this.

31
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,440
So back from that what is AB operators.

32
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:50,930
I end up ready to use it to compare memory locations of two billion of two objects.

33
00:02:51,060 --> 00:03:02,140
As we know everything is an object in Python so let's declare two variables equal in busy quilt.

34
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:09,620
Nine And let's check with the first operator is.

35
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:21,420
Let's check with an X is Y X is B and B X is be upgraded to variable x and B and we are taking that

36
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:27,380
with the memory location of X the same as in the middle of a location of B with a 9 is a member that

37
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:28,430
is night.

38
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,330
It should be 5.

39
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:33,210
Of course that is not my next goal.

40
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:38,940
It is not is not operator X is not B.

41
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:45,120
Of course the value should be true because it is not known to.

42
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:49,230
So this is all about the operators.

43
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:52,700
So we came to know about different operators in this tutorial.

44
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:58,070
Like I you operate as membership operate as logical operate as bitwise assignment combination of them

45
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:58,890
anti-GOP it is so.

46
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:03,900
So this is all about operators and by that we also learn one example with each one of them.

47
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:07,390
I hope this helps with some of your learning process.
