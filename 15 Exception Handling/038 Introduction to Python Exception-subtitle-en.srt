00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:02,810
Welcome to the By tend to do it here.

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:07,480
Today we are going to talk about acception in Python.

3
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:13,460
An exception is event which occur during the execution of the program.

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:19,750
Or we can say an exception is the adder which can be handled by the program.

5
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:27,630
The exception which are already available in the Python are called the built in exception.

6
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:35,130
One more thing don't confuse between the error and the exception because edit and exceptions are not

7
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:36,570
the same.

8
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:44,730
Suppose if the program again gets an error in the program and he can do something to emulate the error

9
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:47,520
then it is called an exception.

10
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:56,040
If the programmer cannot do anything in case of error then it is called an error not an exception.

11
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:02,570
A programmer can create his own exception code use a pain exception.

12
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:07,070
Now let's move to the example where we can see how exception.

13
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:07,820
Ago.

14
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:16,050
So first let's understand about the syntax error and how it is different from exception because sometime

15
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:20,710
be confused between syntax error and the exception errors.

16
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:24,550
So let's move to the examples here.

17
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:32,400
I open a Python script and after that and agreed to fi's one for syntax error and the second for exception.

18
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,520
So first I'm going to get a program where we can see what is a syntax error.

19
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:43,290
So first I simply dig in both

20
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,370
some values.

21
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:58,450
So here we can see this is the input which is stored in the variable x.

22
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:09,990
So after that I'll simply break the values of x here we we've done this Mordieu and you can see we get

23
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:12,800
a result to give some values.

24
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:16,480
But then they get the result.

25
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:19,360
So what is a syntax error in this program.

26
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:22,270
When I can but do I.

27
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:25,120
And B you all d.

28
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:32,480
Then here we can see we get a syntax error in this program.

29
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,650
So this is a syntax error.

30
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:38,670
And now I'm going to tell you what is the exception.

31
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:42,620
So first I'm going to again dig in Buddh

32
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:57,140
And doesn't this and this input is indeed a type.

33
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:07,060
And after that I'll simply print off X so this in user input is stored in this ex-buddy and this expeditor

34
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:18,510
will printed out not this do you can see the program is correctly done after that and simply put in

35
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:19,500
3.

36
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,100
Then we get one day.

37
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,570
It is old now.

38
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:32,010
I wonder this program again is going to simply type hello which is a string.

39
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:39,050
We get a value error so these errors are exception error which means that these errors can be handled

40
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,650
by a programmer.

41
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:49,320
So this is the difference between syntax error and exception error syntax error can't handle by a programmer

42
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:53,250
but the exception can be handled by the programmer.
