1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,800
In this studio I'm going to teach you how to handle the exception.

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:13,890
So why we need to handle the exception because the purpose of handling the acceptance is to make the

3
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:22,110
program robust robust means a strong robust program does not terminate in the middle.

4
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:30,900
So now let's move to the examples before going to like some example we need to know what the steps followed

5
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,950
to handle the exception.

6
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:43,890
So the first step is try block by block means then there may be a possibility of exception in the program

7
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,520
the programmer will put all the code in the try block.

8
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:53,670
The second step is except block the program.

9
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:54,370
Right.

10
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:59,260
Except block where he should misplay the exception to do.

11
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:03,930
Or a custom message that the.

12
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,380
Finally finally block is hidden in the master.

13
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:16,700
And finally block I use to execute the program vendor the exception or not.

14
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:23,080
So now let's move to that example to understand the exception handling here.

15
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:30,970
I just opened up items and now I'm going to create a simple program to show you how to handle the exception.

16
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,390
So now as I already said the quarter should we keep inside the block.

17
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,610
So I simply wanted to print something

18
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,520
and write something.

19
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:54,760
And after that they just said the second step is to accept

20
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:00,000
it will burn some messes.

21
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:03,530
If the code is incorrect inside the block

22
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:13,200
I need some Going to the

23
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,460
here and now.

24
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:22,020
And where is my due.

25
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:24,750
So here I'm going to simply write something with.

26
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:28,600
Hello world here.

27
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,270
We did not get any error.

28
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:39,130
And now I'm going to get something inside this used of move this character insert the input matter.

29
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:42,230
This input my part is incorrect.

30
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,680
And now I'm I this more do.

31
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:50,960
So here to get up except Messers please write something correctly.

32
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:59,170
We did not get any error message because the excerpt will simply show you the user defined message.

33
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:09,510
And when I simply print this money again we get the exact lizard which is.

34
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:18,740
So this is a block and this is the except block and now I'm going to create a simple example to understand

35
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,190
the exception handling more.

36
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:30,630
And now I'm using my loop after that and I put two and in the loop when I declare I blog.

37
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:34,410
And except look inside the table.

38
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,400
It will take some input.

39
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,440
We do which is in brute

40
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:56,900
then after that it will break the block.

41
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,800
If the input is correct

42
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:14,320
and that except block that I'd clue.

43
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:19,750
So now I'm going to do this in boot.

44
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,740
So here it's very well except for indecent.

45
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:34,600
Well you know I'm one of them this morning to say the program is executed correctly and I'm glad I did

46
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,940
something did.

47
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,850
So it would accept in Deezer.

48
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:45,170
And now let's do it again hello.

49
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:49,890
You can see please write correctly this except block will.

50
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:53,240
So a message please write correctly.

51
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,490
After that if again something is true.

52
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:57,610
We get the message.

53
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,250
Please.

54
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:04,120
Correctly so until it will get busier that it will persist.

55
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:11,600
So this is the absolute example to understand the block and accept Block.

56
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:16,030
And now we are going to use a finally block in this program

57
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:24,730
to simply being a massive do over.

58
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:30,870
Which means that this final blog will not depend on this excerpt and this type blog

59
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:37,940
whenever we type in December.

60
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:42,440
You can see the live blog is executed.

61
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:52,390
And now if you have some different venue which is Astrue so you can see this either accept the message.

62
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:54,600
And this is the final message.

63
00:05:54,710 --> 00:06:02,070
So here we can see the final message will not depend on this excerpt and this blog.

64
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:09,010
If your dialogue is right or wrong this time statement of in print at the end.

65
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:10,540
So this is not optional.

66
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:15,590
Instead the exception so if you want to print something and the last.

67
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:17,560
Then we use the find the live blog.

68
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:20,060
Or if you want to exclude something in the last.

69
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:23,190
Then we have to use the final block.

70
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:26,290
So this is about our exception in Python.
