00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:08,320
Welcome to the I think tutorial today we are going to learn how to send email by using Python script.

2
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:12,670
So here I just opened up my script and when I create a simple program.

3
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:17,410
So first we have to import our library which is as I'm typing library.

4
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:25,560
I seem to be striving for simple made tons of protocol which means that some type is used to send an

5
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:33,810
email to the mail server and days of pop which is most of his protocol and receivers server which is

6
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:35,810
used to receive the mail.

7
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:47,020
So now let's import the some to Libet images and then we'll be able maybe after that get to read the

8
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:47,850
content.

9
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:53,050
So he used a radio which is contained You can write anything.

10
00:00:53,450 --> 00:01:06,580
And now here I just wrote Hello I am from witen and now ask could that be used as some debris library

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:15,740
which is maybe equal to Melis a variable you can use anything and simply be maybe Daut capital S.

12
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:22,390
DP You just simple made Tromso portable and insert the bread into his just I.

13
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:28,930
I simply thought gmail dot com.

14
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:35,260
So here we have a free mail server which just some degree that gmail dot com which is from Google.

15
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:49,150
And now when I say some degree Holstrom which is 5:57 and after that I just write me men don't at all

16
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,580
and put get into this in the next line.

17
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:55,470
I straight male toward the start

18
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:03,520
DNS.

19
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:12,460
So these are the inbuilt method which we used in Python to send any messages displayed or luggin to

20
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:13,680
lowering the function.

21
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,910
We did use to log into our account.

22
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:19,010
So here I just put in my e-mail account which is

23
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:29,710
after that I just put one password and then the next line is to use mail.

24
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:32,310
Don't send mail.

25
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,720
Put are all on the function which we are used.

26
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:38,170
So from.

27
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:42,230
So here we put the e-mail address from.

28
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:43,760
So it just might.

29
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:44,280
It does

30
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:55,930
after the fact that I had that e-mail address to do just

31
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:07,510
board.

32
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:17,100
And after that I just put content which is on message and now I just write mail don't close random it

33
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,020
is send.

34
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,430
And now nexted on this Mordieu

35
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:29,080
or key.

36
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:33,180
We did docket and it means there the man is saying.

37
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:37,990
And now let's work with the to Boucek whether it is sent or not.

38
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:50,110
The sign here by using them 3 3 5 0 3 3 which is what I see what you mean I just put the password.

39
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:56,410
So here because of the way that it is received or not.

40
00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:05,410
So here you can see the first message or just click on the sender human and the content which is hello

41
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,230
I'm from Brighton.

42
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,420
So this is the way to send any message to any e-mail addresses.
