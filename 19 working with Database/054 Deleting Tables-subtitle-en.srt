Welcome to the Python tutorial today we are going to learn how to drop a table or we can say how to

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:13,040
keep some values from the table by using my Escuela what went as well as writing a script.

3
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:15,880
So now let's move to the my ethical work bench.

4
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:20,040
So here first we have to use the test which is a database.

5
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:29,390
So here I just would come on enter and now I'm going to see how many values are there in my database.

6
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:34,990
So here we are selecting store from in LA.

7
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:37,460
So employees are able to hit enter.

8
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:42,870
So here we have two values or because of two rows which is elex and Peter and having everyone in two

9
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:54,580
and now I'm going to lead one to by using our delete key word BP and the delete from name of the table

10
00:00:54,580 --> 00:01:03,020
which is employ after that and straight to we're I will do one.

11
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:08,070
So here I use equal to one because ideas are unique for all the rows.

12
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,400
So after that hit command enter.

13
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:13,920
So now when I check whether it is affected or not

14
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:21,030
from the no employee just click command enter.

15
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:24,200
So you can see the ID when it is deleted.

16
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:27,690
Which means that the first row is deleted.

17
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:32,010
And now let's move to the bitless script to delete the Sikander.

18
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:34,420
Or you can say delete the second ID.

19
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:44,780
So just copy some command Drood from employees and most of the vitamines script not just based here.

20
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,350
So no exit good.

21
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:56,270
So you can see did front employ we are equal to to allow see if this more to do.

22
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:01,720
And John so here we did not get any error.

23
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:08,160
So let's move to the my SchoolBook bent to see whether it is affected or not.

24
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:10,660
And after that he'd come on enter.

25
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:15,640
So you can see there's a NORDO which means that all the rows are deleted.

26
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,710
So the first is deleted from my Eskil work bench.

27
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,450
And the second row is deleted from the bitless script.

28
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:28,620
So this is the process to delete the values or we can say delete the rows from database.
