It might come so before getting started.

3
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:16,650
We have to install some packages or we can say some software to use might as well be fun.

00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:19,450
So here we have some software.

10
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:49,170
So here I just open a composer and insert but you can type my Esquith dot com slash downloads after

11
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:49,800

00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:37,940
So here you can see we have to log in or sign up for download this software but we have another link

22
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:38,870

00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,150
So I just skip the video.

29
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:04,770
So here you can see the download process is completed and now here we might as well come into the server.

30
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:10,430
So now let's move to the second download which is my screen workbench for this.
