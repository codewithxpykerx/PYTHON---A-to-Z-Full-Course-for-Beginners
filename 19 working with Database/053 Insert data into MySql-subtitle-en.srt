1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,510
Welcome to them why don't you do it today.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:10,770
We're going to learn how to insert data in our database by using my Escuela workbench as well as by

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,960
tenis script here.

4
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:20,930
I just opened up my school of workbench and now we use our database which is just after that and hit

5
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:21,500
enter.

6
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:30,600
We just come on Enter NOW and when I insert some data by using Insert key word so he destroyed it.

7
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:40,010
After that going to employed so employees are table in our database.

8
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:42,680
After that it took pass some paramita.

9
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,780
So the first parameter is the ID.

10
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:48,620
Second one is only the Tortoni's A B or B.

11
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,400
And the last one is an e-mail.

12
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:57,860
After that write a values and entered the appendices we have to assign some values.

13
00:00:57,890 --> 00:00:59,440
The first one is ID.

14
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:01,120
So here I just write one.

15
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,170
So ID is indeed fooled.

16
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:05,910
The second one has a name field which is a string.

17
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:12,160
So you just straight elex the turban is also the string.

18
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:13,750
But it is a date of birth.

19
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:19,280
So here it is right 1989 0 9 and grindy.

20
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,920
So this is the format to write a did in my A-squared.

21
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:28,150
After that the last one is a human so you can pass any human

22
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:34,340
right after the bad analysis and he'd come on to enter.

23
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:38,920
And here you can see the table is created and one is affected.

24
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:46,220
And now I'm going to show you how to see the values from the table by writing select Esterbrook Mark

25
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,970
and from employee and hit enter.

26
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:57,110
Here you can see the names Alex and headed or both and Gannascoli is the e-mail.

27
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:03,180
So this is the process to insert a data in our database by using might as workbench.

28
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:08,430
And now let's move to the bitless script insert a data in our database.

29
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:19,840
So here I just copy all the values we just insert into and after that I'll paste here 10 days.

30
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,910
In addition as I just.

31
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,770
Are Indian correct manner.

32
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:30,240
So here the values are inserted and now at last I have to write.

33
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:35,480
SIEGEL And with is variable connection for that period.

34
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:44,670
And now I'm going to commit these values in our database and now that and just want do sort a view of

35
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:46,380
the things and venues here.

36
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,700
Name is Peter

37
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:59,420
the idea as to the date or something like that which is nineteen ninety

38
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:10,010
and the image is also jeunes hotmail dot com.

39
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:15,440
So now to save this and this Mordieu.

40
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:17,490
So here we did not get any error.

41
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:22,760
So let's move to my school workbench to see whether it is been started or not.

42
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,260
I'm going to clear this one now.

43
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:34,110
First I have to use a test it is using command enter and the second one is a select start from employees

44
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:42,840
just click command enter so you can see the second ID is to name the Peter and part 1 is the date of

45
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:47,750
birth which is 1990 and the last one is that in C there are 12 are gone.

46
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:53,340
So this is the process to insert a data by using up by a script.

47
00:03:53,340 --> 00:04:01,410
So despite your mice could command regions of mice will code in your eggs a good but entities here and

48
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:03,600
now I'm going to show you the data.

49
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:12,100
You know I can script to just do don't come here just write but and microcell

50
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:31,220
don't fetch on and then just more do so there's some and I'm not there said to fetch I think these are

51
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:32,490
some I don't.

52
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:41,630
Because if you write some code which is Microsoft Daut exiguous.

53
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:43,300
So stay with us.

54
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:50,820
So Damons and ahu on this Monday.

55
00:04:52,670 --> 00:05:02,900
We got the result which is employer and student and now we're right here which is and it's the Senate

56
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:10,250
star from the M B and O Y employer.

57
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:15,000
This will fetch all the data as you see in my school work bench.

58
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:19,280
We just select the star from employees when we click hit enter.

59
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:20,790
So there is a pop up.

60
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:22,490
So all the details here.

61
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:27,370
Also we just select a star from Employee table and this morning you

62
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:37,160
we get a result which is the name did second or the name date.

63
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:42,500
So this is the process to insert data and to show the data by using Pythonesque.
