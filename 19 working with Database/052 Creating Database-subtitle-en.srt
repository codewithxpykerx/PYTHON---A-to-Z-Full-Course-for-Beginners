1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:07,110
Welcome to the site and to it you today we are going to learn how to use my as quilt or against the

2
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:15,020
How To date my ex will come on in Brighton and how to get your data from my screen using Python scripts.

3
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:19,630
So we had already download our software to get this done on my server.

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:26,610
Just from Systrom could fence my Esquith and start oh my Esquith server.

5
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,690
Just put your system password

6
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:35,780
so here you can see the server is running now.

7
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,140
Just click when the mice are dead.

8
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,440
Just click on my Esquith workbench.

9
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:48,790
So here we have my Escuela workbench click on local Steinem's So here you have to put up use a root

10
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:49,580
password.

11
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:56,910
So in this we do we are just copied the user password and now I'm going to based here after then just

12
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:57,860
click OK.

13
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:01,300
So here you can see the password is expired.

14
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:06,100
So we have to make another password so just put you on the password after that.

15
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:07,840
Just put your new password

16
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,830
just click OK.

17
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,730
That put your new password in here again.

18
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:23,760
Just click OK.

19
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,300
So here we have a debate.

20
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,240
Just click on minimize after that.

21
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:32,730
Just create your own database by using some commands.

22
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:35,230
Which is good.

23
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:42,000
It is a name that it is obvious which is just after the word click.

24
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:43,530
C'mon.

25
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:48,860
So here you can see the database created when I click refresh.

26
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:50,220
So here we have a test date.

27
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:52,210
I was informed that it was.

28
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:56,060
We have some table views and some function.

29
00:01:56,260 --> 00:02:01,150
So this is the way to create a database by using my Esquith workbench.

30
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:04,970
We can clear the same breeder base using my script also.

31
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:12,570
So here I just opened up my script and now I'm going to implement all my code to connect my Esquith.

32
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:23,840
So first we have to import a library which is import in secret or connector.

33
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,680
After that you have to make some connection.

34
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,610
So first we have to declare a variable which is C or D and you can write anything on behalf of C M.

35
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:43,030
Now after that we use this library and my Esquith connector but connect

36
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:53,060
the the in Texas we have to pass some values which we use to connect our database so the first one is

37
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:59,440
a user which is what the second one is.

38
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:00,680
Password

39
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:04,340
which is

40
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:13,660
the target one is Horst which is localhost

41
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,530
and the last one is the database.

42
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:27,320
So if you are working with your current it is then you could declare your database here which is just

43
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:39,950
in the third line and when I use the cursor which is my cursor so my answer is a variable.

44
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:44,060
So you can write anything on behalf of my Cosel.

45
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:48,070
After that I'm going to use the connection which you see will never end.

46
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,620
So this variable.

47
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:57,980
After that I'm going to write a function which is called a function and in the fourth line I'm going

48
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:03,770
to execute some code to fetch the data from the database.

49
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,450
So for that we are right

50
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:15,780
Microsoft Daut execute an sort of.

51
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:27,290
But in Texas you do Baso short Bebo's which is my Esquith come on and in the last line we have to bring

52
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:29,430
the database values.

53
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:35,460
So here I just straight my cursor not fat.

54
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:38,620
On.

55
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:40,160
So now let's run this more do

56
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:44,380
so here.

57
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:48,350
We did not get any values because our database is empty.

58
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:55,090
So now let's move to the workbench and not get some tables inside our destiny database.

59
00:04:55,090 --> 00:05:03,710
So for that the first line which is use is come under after that.

60
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:11,620
And when a did or table cleared Deeble a neighbor table is employed.

61
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,720
Just come on enter here.

62
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:22,090
Kitzbuhel error which means that we have to add some column inside the table.

63
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:25,730
So the first one is the ID column after that.

64
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:29,950
And then after that you have to pass up the key

65
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:39,580
just put comma and the second is a name and the name is a variable character.

66
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:42,010
So for that we away.

67
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:47,830
And after I'd like to prentices and insert the bandages we have to write them in.

68
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,760
These are very.

69
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:55,010
So this is the way Luke is used to limit this character which means that we can only write the name

70
00:05:55,430 --> 00:06:06,410
from one to three words after that I'm going to use that about the only images or did time for this

71
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:12,760
day time them Laghi and Velika these all are key words in my Esquith from the last one.

72
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:14,340
These are human

73
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:24,420
which is the label collector just working and in the patent this is just past 20.

74
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,710
So here I just

75
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:33,050
put the command center so you can see the table is created.

76
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:34,450
We just employ.

77
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,410
So here we can refresh this data.

78
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:40,660
So inside the database we have an employee table.

79
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:43,050
Let's move to the script.

80
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:46,350
So now I'm going again on this Mordieu.

81
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:49,260
So here we get the result we just employ.

82
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:55,220
And now I'm going to be at the same table by using Python script.

83
00:06:55,260 --> 00:07:02,490
So here just write the same line just from there.

84
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:16,130
Come on we can after that just change the name of the table which is student.

85
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,130
Now and this morning you

86
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:29,140
in the latest gaining strength lifter.

87
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,830
So we have some error here.

88
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,170
So I think there are some indentation error.

89
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,020
So now.

90
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:38,610
So then just do it again.

91
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:48,000
So here the process is completed and now it just blows this and goes to my school abutments.

92
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:53,460
Just click on refresh so you can see the student table is created.

93
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:00,990
So this is the way to create a table by using my Eskil what went and this is the way to create a table

94
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:07,860
using Python command that's all about for creating a table using my full workbench and the right hand

95
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:08,410
commands.
