1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:09,310
Welcome to buy them to do today we are going to talk about numbers in Brighton.

2
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:19,470
Now my is in big debt I live in Brighton which is used to store a numeric value which means that number

3
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:25,440
always used to store up in desirable not to string values.

4
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,510
So this is all about numbers in Python.

5
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:31,770
Now let us understand through a simple example.

6
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:42,140
Here I will bring up my pencil and now I'm going is a good example of number how you can say I assigned

7
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:45,040
a numeric value in a variable.

8
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,960
Now do this again isn't it.

9
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:52,060
Which means that the variable is stored the numeric value.

10
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:54,380
So this is the example of numbers.

11
00:00:54,820 --> 00:01:05,010
And now as we know that by support for different numeric type which is indeed a long integer flawed

12
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:07,160
and complex.

13
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:10,610
So you already know in the long and bitter.

14
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:13,390
I'm going to explain you flawed and complex.

15
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:19,560
Now for float equal to seventeen point six.

16
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:20,610
This is a float.

17
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:23,260
Welcome to Q&amp;A.

18
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,180
Having good results and in 1:06 which means that they're very well Istana.

19
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:41,310
Well Lou now for complex values equal to the helpless 45 which means that really the deal part and a

20
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,680
45 is a million.

21
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:50,790
But again my goodness we get our complex Velu which means that you'd automatically store the new value

22
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,600
which is a complex value.

23
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:55,610
So it is all about to buy 10.

24
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:03,270
Now I'm going to spin you some method which is used in numbers.

25
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:08,760
Now the first method is absolute method which is s method.

26
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:14,110
Now for that simply that is a good absolute method.

27
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:19,980
When I get a variable and giving them a loan minus Well it is a negative value.

28
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:30,060
Now when I bring this value with absolute method to ABS and to help me get the absolute 12 it is a positive

29
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,390
in the value.

30
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:34,260
So these is all about the absolute value.

31
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:44,650
The next method is the sealing method which is denoted by c i l this function are not accessible directly.

32
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:49,510
So we need to import more Mondial called a method model.

33
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:55,070
Initially I'm going to import a model which isn't Mathman do.

34
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:58,240
Now I'm going to execute a program.

35
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:02,260
After that I'll explain you what is the scene method.

36
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:05,130
So now initially giving of a little.

37
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:07,240
One two three.

38
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:13,050
And now I'm going to print is Velu using Mathman do it.

39
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:19,940
I call her my model.

40
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:27,420
So here we get the result Hardeen which means that Silma thirds are always stored the smallest and zero

41
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:29,300
value which is good at that.

42
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:32,380
And then the reference reference will do.

43
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:37,020
So it is the smallest and is a value greater than the reference value.

44
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:44,430
I think today is the smallest and is of value after the twelve point three to three.

45
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:52,370
It will not give you the floor well it will always give you the invisible or we can say that C are used

46
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:55,320
to start the next value.

47
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:57,540
So whatever else you have you get.

48
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:01,080
You had given Google Print 2 4 2 3 9 8.

49
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:04,630
Anything it would simply give you the next in.

50
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:07,930
So this is that Hardeen in the next indiscernible.

51
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,650
So now this is all about the cell method.

52
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:17,720
The next 23rd is the floor my third floor My third is just similar to the Silma third.

53
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,630
So initially we have to import our model Matt

54
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:23,770
here.

55
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,760
I'm going to execute a program.

56
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:27,320
After that I'll explain you

57
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:43,280
equal to twelve point two three and now I'm going to call this my third.

58
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,340
So here we get the results.

59
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:52,230
Well so which means third floor are used to that the largest in deserve no less than the reference vendor.

60
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:58,060
So which is the largest and is of value is not greater than this reference value.

61
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:02,980
So I think well is the largest And is it a venue or we considered flawed.

62
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:09,130
Are used to get our previous in these Ravello as the reference value.

63
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:14,370
So the previous indiscernible knew then the reference values the Gwen.

64
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:22,210
So if you put padding point three four fourteen point four we will get the previous interior below which

65
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:24,380
is 13 or 14.

66
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:28,250
So these are all about the floor method.

67
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:36,170
The next method is exponential method exponential method is just similar to the math exponential method.

68
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:40,450
So these methods are not accessible directly.

69
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:42,960
So we need to import my math model

70
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,050
here.

71
00:05:47,070 --> 00:06:00,420
I boarded a math model and now I'm going to simply print our exponential value of two.

72
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:02,250
So here we get the result.

73
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,740
Seven point thirty eight.

74
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:08,590
So this is all about the exponential method.

75
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:15,260
The next method is a maximum of 10 denoted by a x.

76
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:19,930
So for that we don't need to import a math model.

77
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:24,940
We can access directly so equal to max

78
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:32,130
45 and 2.

79
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:38,950
Parent of a new.

80
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:41,770
So here we get the desired 45.

81
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:46,270
So 45 is the maximum in this list of item.

82
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:48,250
So this all about the Maxima entered.

83
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:58,160
The next method is the min method and be considered a minimum method for that equal to m i n.

84
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:58,860
Right.

85
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:00,950
And Jim you were in the same variable

86
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:08,850
I mean print.

87
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,720
Really.

88
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:14,780
So here we get the minimum value which is too.

89
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:17,780
So it is all about the minimum method.

90
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:21,850
The next method is the power method the power method.

91
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:28,030
It is similar to the mathematics method which means there are two to the poultry two to about four.

92
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:38,070
What they were really good about it was simply give the lizard for that and would simply exit the bar

93
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:40,540
method.

94
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:47,660
So first we have to import a math model because these methods are not accessible directly.

95
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:58,930
Now I'm going to print Velu B or W and now two former three hit trees the power of this it offends Velu

96
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:01,490
so any heavy get the result.

97
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:08,450
Which means that dude with about three is eight which is due to the power three is it.

98
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:11,650
So these is all about the power method.

99
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:19,720
The next time a third is A-squared mentored A-squared method it does similar to the Met A-squared.

100
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:31,090
So for that we have to first import Ahmadullah Matt and now I'm actually going to print spreaded real

101
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:34,540
math Dorte Eskew.

102
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,380
Hundred.

103
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:43,570
So we get the deserts and this kind of squared up hundred is simpler then.

104
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,510
So there's almost a square root method.

105
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:49,760
The next method is a mod method.

106
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:57,820
More death method is used to get in zero value apart under floatable really do our part which means

107
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:02,030
that you'll get the sceptered value of that and the float.

108
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:08,780
So now fussily and we import Ahmadullah meant and now England execute the program.

109
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,260
After that explain you

110
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:19,010
mean f and giving of a lapel pin 9 0.

111
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:20,720
So we get that Izard here.

112
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:28,180
This is a flawed part of this reference Lewton which is gulper 9:0 and this is a robot which is a.

113
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:34,880
So what math more deft does it will separate the Indie's revenue and the floor.

114
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:37,160
Well Lou in different parts.

115
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:45,250
So this is all about the mod f method the last method is the logger method not method really don't need

116
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:48,970
to logarithmic Melu are the best value.

117
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:52,550
So for that we have to import a model.

118
00:09:52,850 --> 00:10:02,090
And I'm going to simply execute our lock and value we'll do metadata log and hit plan.

119
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,110
And the base is also 10.

120
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,460
And is the base.

121
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,280
So here we get the result 1.

122
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:14,970
So we know that locked down is the one that is all about number in Brighton.
