1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:01,440
Hire one.

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:04,130
Now let's have a look at why then.

3
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:05,140
Ellis.

4
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:11,960
And as statements here I have created a new client statements.

5
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:14,090
We work in the same location

6
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:31,750
in this you will learn to read decisions in the program using Eve and live and as statements.

7
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:38,800
Decision making is required when we want to execute a call or leave a certain condition is satisfied.

8
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:45,060
Though if elif and statements are used by them for decision making

9
00:00:48,790 --> 00:01:03,660
those is the syntax for if else and as conditions here the program evaluates the best expression and

10
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:11,360
then execute statements only if the best expression is true.

11
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:16,350
Otherwise it would check for the best expression of a list.

12
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:29,230
And this means the short form all ends if and if are the best expression is true or at least is get

13
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:41,020
executed and if not the control will go to the else statement and the else statement is the last one.

14
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:53,070
And if the condition is met then the body was and will be get executed and we have the flowchart of

15
00:01:54,180 --> 00:02:01,930
the if elif and else statements over here as we see in the index itself.

16
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:05,560
The best description of if we could executed.

17
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:15,110
If so we also are testing whether the disposition is true.

18
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:26,460
If will be good exit conduct and if it is not true then the best description of Eliphaz evaluate and

19
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:29,690
check for whether it is true or false.

20
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:39,070
And if it is true value of Eliphaz get executed and if not the value of as is get executed and it will

21
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:45,150
be more clear then we do a program.

22
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:55,770
So let's go to the Sublime Text and let nothing equals three

23
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,690
and the first statement it is the east statement.

24
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:07,660
If they did then do.

25
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:21,700
This is the best expression andere this if conditions loyalty is identified by the indentation here

26
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:26,110
the in addition stops and we have a print expression here.

27
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:35,250
But it is positive.

28
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:46,250
And the if Baldie is terminated dirt while it sees a Norling the deadlock.

29
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:52,410
So here we have the as if that is our airlift condition over here.

30
00:03:52,930 --> 00:04:01,900
Elif now equal to equal to zero gender linked

31
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,240
no means zero.

32
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:19,430
Here you might have far northeast YV using double equal to or we'll hear you single equal notation will

33
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:29,990
assign a value to a variable but the debit equal sign is used to compare the value.

34
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:34,440
So the last one ends here.

35
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,440
We can have

36
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,530
no expression is

37
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:49,600
not means negative

38
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,380
so that's it.

39
00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:02,650
So just go to the terminal and clear the screen.

40
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:05,200
Then go to the all

41
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:12,250
Biden statements don't be very tender now.

42
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:25,930
Supposedly since we are given the three positive integer it is bring the vast numbers positive and if

43
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:34,120
we change this to minus 3 then save it and go to the terminal again.

44
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,400
Then run the code again.

45
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:42,110
There now is negative and the flow of program is like this.

46
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:53,550
The minus 3 is get assigned to the number number and the if condition checks whether the number is greater

47
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:59,180
than zero or not and nor do you want greater than zero.

48
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:09,450
So it will not print not supposedly And if condition is not also get satisfied so the else condition

49
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:14,720
is satisfied and thus it brings now is negative.

50
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:26,160
That's how the IIF Elif and else statements walk in Python and we can have the

51
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:32,100
same code like this here.

52
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:37,950
If Nauman greater than or equal to zero if not equal we call the zoo.

53
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:41,350
This yf is inside this.

54
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:50,480
If so it is nested IF ELSE condition and none is greater than Oracle.

55
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:54,400
So let's do this 2 3 again and see if it.

56
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:58,590
So now the condition is East condition is true.

57
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:03,310
It is greater than zero and now it will check for it.

58
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:12,380
No equally will do then it will print 0 and if else then it will print.

59
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,800
It is a positive number.

60
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,950
Since we are using all by then.

61
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,040
2.7.

62
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,960
We don't need this brackets.

63
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:29,110
That's one of the difference between by the dewpoint 7 and by the do 3.

64
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:32,210
So let's run this call again.

65
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:39,060
Then go to the terminal and again then it is positive number.

66
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:45,020
That's the IIF Elif and Else statement.

67
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,340
By that that's all for now.

68
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:50,520
Keep watching.

69
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:50,910
Thank you.
