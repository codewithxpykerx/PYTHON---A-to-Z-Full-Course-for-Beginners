1
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:09,090
Heidi folks today the if statements in by then basically a statement has the ability to believe a conditions

2
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,570
based on which the behavior of the program.

3
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:14,100
Our goal our goal will be all that.

4
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:21,510
So this will this index up if statement of expression do something based on the resultant value of this

5
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:22,260
expression.

6
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:28,470
I mean whether it was true or false based on will continue to execute the next statement which was nothing

7
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:31,480
but do something or whatever the goal was here.

8
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:33,570
All right let's see an example of that interpreter

9
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:47,990
digital area will NSA do it.

10
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:49,660
All right.

11
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:55,460
Let's update this statement on the boat.

12
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:57,250
It

13
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,010
is

14
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:28,630
Biden initially executed this expression whether Hello exist in this string variable in tone what is

15
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:34,600
string theory will stream has a value of hello world in it and hence Biden has checked whether halo

16
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:39,220
exists in this hello world if it exits by then executive the next statement.

17
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:43,410
I mean the next line of code which was nothing but then hooray.

18
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:50,400
So that's what about using statements on particular string in Python.

19
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:53,050
Let's play this if statement on a list that.

20
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:25,070
Right now I'll play this statement on the claim list very

21
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:44,860
is

22
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:49,530
awesome.

23
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:56,900
So Biden initially has exhibited this expression and it has checked whether string hello x is in the

24
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:57,890
list variable.

25
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,830
I mean which has a do items in it.

26
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,680
Hello world.

27
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:07,180
And if that exits Biden has gone to exit the next statement which has been yes.

28
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:15,290
And then the result was yes that which was intended for us.

29
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:16,660
All right.

30
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:29,330
Let's see that example.

31
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:50,390
All right now in this statement or I play this statement on a Modica available

32
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:14,010
you have the output.

33
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:18,940
So this is a process of using IF statements and by the old times guys.
