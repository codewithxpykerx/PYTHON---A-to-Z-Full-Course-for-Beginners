00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:09,740
Welcome to the right into doing today we are going to talk about mood control statements in Python so

2
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:16,550
you can call Instagram's are a blatant statement know continuing statement.

3
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:18,790
So what is the biggest regret.

4
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:26,390
Biggest J-20 simply used to edit the loop or you can say that you're simply used to break the loo.

5
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:32,530
After that it will go to the next line or next statement.

6
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:35,490
So this is all out to make a statement.

7
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:44,440
So now let us understand a big statement to a simple program here opened up our offensive and now I'm

8
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,930
using a closed loop to understand the biggest Dittman

9
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:00,850
yet strangely the simple character.

10
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:10,730
So now I initially print simple for loop to get the result from Asked to Z which is a simple for loop

11
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:11,650
result.

12
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:41,340
Now what happened when I put a great question mark this in said this bording that I lose if condition.

13
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:48,030
So here you can see this is the if condition for data structure and condition.

14
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:52,180
So now after and after the condition and put the second statement

15
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,520
which is a hello.

16
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,020
It was simply Brinda.

17
00:01:58,070 --> 00:01:58,720
Hello.

18
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:01,750
So now if maybe it would be quick do I.

19
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:05,030
Which means that when a variable goes to the addition of.

20
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:12,320
I inserted this character it will simply break the loop and Worcester next line or to that next statement

21
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,230
which is this the statement.

22
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:16,770
So now I run this group name.

23
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:19,490
Now you can see what happened.

24
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:27,410
So here you can see we could simply did the loop after the architecture which means that when a variable

25
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:33,040
goes to the iPod you can simply break the new one goes to the next line which is a Hello.

26
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:38,500
So now I change the character in this video book.

27
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:47,540
So now you can see they did not get inside this character so to simply put in the condition because

28
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:54,800
if condition is not satisfied so it will simply print that as condition as condition as condition is

29
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,150
simply a string.

30
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:02,610
After that it was simply the slip in the next statement.

31
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:12,970
Now I like good this program so I can see there isn't no big things at this result so it will simply

32
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:15,260
print Renda from S to Z.

33
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:17,930
After that it will print the second line.

34
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,500
So this is all about to make a statement.

35
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,840
So now what do you want.

36
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:33,680
Granted your statement continued statement is simply used to skip the loop and goes to the next iteration.

37
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:36,720
Here I see you do good to the next iteration.

38
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:43,370
Not in the next line so it will simply skip the loop and goes to the next iteration.

39
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,510
So this is all about continuous check statement.

40
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:49,890
I didn't understand through a simple example here.

41
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:52,910
I again open a potential and now I am.

42
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:56,430
I've been using a for loop to understand a continuous statement

43
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:10,180
where again a string is a character

44
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:20,440
I'm against celebrity but simply for very good.

45
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:23,560
Those are the Jersey which is simple for liberty.

46
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:32,150
Now why pick Brenneman I put in a statement and he said this portaloo of course that I used to

47
00:04:54,740 --> 00:05:03,410
so Hedican see if nobody ever goes to the position of I'm in this esteem it will simply skip the loop.

48
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:09,590
Or we can say that it will simply escape the character and go to the next edition.

49
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,540
And after that we do the deed.

50
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:20,250
So this is the continue side of this for look at that and put in a statement after the current you know

51
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:22,010
new

52
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:30,810
do the hello could disprove them.

53
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:33,540
So here we can get Brazil hit again soon.

54
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:37,810
No I didn't said this reserve which means there is a.

55
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,010
And after that it goes to an energy of in the loop was completed.

56
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,990
It will goes to the next line.

57
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,760
So this is all about the continuous treatment.
