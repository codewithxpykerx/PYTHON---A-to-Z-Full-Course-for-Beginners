1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:08,760
Hi everyone let's get started in the last two Duryea we have done and agreement I mean that we have

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:14,300
used some built in functions like isip and Ostap here.

3
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:19,090
So you might be wondering or is the focus of all these functions here.

4
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:24,000
So let's do have a look at each one of them deeply.

5
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:32,940
So let's start with the C functions here and in order to use all these functions we have to import that

6
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:41,270
isip from you to do things like here and the function returns.

7
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:46,070
I list two books were I to on.

8
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:54,630
The element from each of the argument sequences or it delivers like if one understood here and that

9
00:00:54,630 --> 00:01:03,030
is done listee strangulated in length of the length of show argument sequence and when there are multiple

10
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,770
arguments which are all of the same length.

11
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:14,820
This function is similar to the map function with any argument of note and with a single Siku an argument

12
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:20,980
it will return a list of one tuple and with no argument it will return an empty list.

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,590
So keep that in mind.

14
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:30,690
And those on the left to right evaluation order of the boots get guaranteed.

15
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,940
So let's have a look at another example.

16
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:46,440
Here we have this x and y having same length and we have C with the C function here like this.

17
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:56,740
This is its index and equal to done first value of false list called My First values second list Colma

18
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:00,160
second value first list.

19
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:01,620
My second rule of second is.

20
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:11,460
And so on and the set in conjunction with this Tottle Braider like here can be used to and simple list

21
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,950
like the second line.

22
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:19,650
The second last line like Q and this book are doing to

23
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:28,350
and no let's do half look good the ice function.

24
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:42,540
The ice function will make an iterator that aggregates elements from each of the if that is like C except

25
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,900
that it returns and it do.

26
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:46,410
Instead of list

27
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:55,720
so the left to right evaluation order of the delivers is guaranteed in this fall.

28
00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:01,290
So let's have a look at the example here.

29
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:05,020
In this we have a do list.

30
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,760
One two three and a b c here.

31
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:16,780
And we are using this ice function here and we are bringing the I then we'll print it like this.

32
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,430
Here you can see

33
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:26,670
here we have not having the square brackets.

34
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:33,430
Like in this so that's the difference.

35
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:36,580
And it is not separated by mom.

36
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,780
Also like

37
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:50,530
and we have another one which is the largest

38
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:56,440
difference of ice and isip largest.

39
00:03:56,830 --> 00:04:12,160
If we are using isip then the ABC and Ex-White will be isip like a x and B Y like this and in the case

40
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:25,000
of iSuppli just it will be like a b c d e x y and we can also supply a food value like minus here and

41
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,360
this will be giving us a x y z.

42
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,110
Right.

43
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:40,610
See this isip and the fill value is combined with the C and D like C dash and B the like this.

44
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,810
So if we are

45
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:52,490
using it then we will not get the C dash dash like here.

46
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:58,470
And we want to play it through value like here.

47
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:08,840
So that's all about I see and I see just now we have another one.

48
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:21,470
The Ostap and the murdered Ostap burns a copy of the string in which all gas has been stripped from

49
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:27,660
the end of the string like a default whitespace characters.

50
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:32,450
So it's you have Fosdick's and we're here we have a species.

51
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:44,900
And before as and after this as we have lot of spaces and after this since we are using Ostap the it

52
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:59,310
will strip the right side of S and we get species like here and easier being a like this then we will

53
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:05,080
get the B D and this is a good strip.

54
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:18,100
And if we are having a B B then it will strip both a B and B and we will get an empty string like this.

55
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:24,590
And in the case of this b c a b b b.

56
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:33,160
If you are slipping a B this food strip this a B and B and B will get ABC on.

57
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:41,390
And we also have Elsje in order stood out from the left side.

58
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:48,960
And if we want to strip some special things in between.

59
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,310
So we have.

60
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:55,110
So we can use also.

61
00:06:55,470 --> 00:07:02,390
So that's all about strip strip and Strip.

62
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:03,640
So keep watching.

63
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:04,180
Thank you.
