1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:09,350
Heidrun now that Stu and ASEAN and which will make use of the file murders and operations and all.

2
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:25,680
So what I'm going to do is I have to create X-File A B C then another player for Apple for banana Fortuny

3
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:40,620
and at last I just want to go and get any old Joy in both these X Files and to make a new file then

4
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:42,180
do the split.

5
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:43,570
That is my modem.

6
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:54,380
So in order to do that I just want to make the don't X Files for first.

7
00:00:54,450 --> 00:01:04,160
So for that I would use the mother again just come and.

8
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:08,170
Don't we all.

9
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:20,050
I just named all the file as a TO SEE see the XTi.

10
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:31,830
And that is in the right not at the end as F 1.

11
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:35,280
And here we.

12
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:46,380
And the other file opening also by just adding a call here and open

13
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,150
floats.

14
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,000
Don't be XTi

15
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:03,740
in the right Modigliani and at the end as

16
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:11,440
then Andoe.

17
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:17,050
And just to add some big data to the water supply it's.

18
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:22,860
So first learn if one thought right.

19
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:33,750
The then just call me this and raised it for five days.

20
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:50,300
So most six days I took it.

21
00:02:50,470 --> 00:03:02,510
Then one door but I be Flunder right I see then if doodled right.

22
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,830
For both

23
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,540
you like

24
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:14,800
for

25
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:25,750
banana slash in your line and for

26
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:29,790
Chevy

27
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:34,360
slash and

28
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:43,900
let's get started on this line over here and don't make this one too.

29
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:50,030
And also add new lines to these lines also.

30
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,660
Just silly.

31
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:05,920
And let's go to the terminal.

32
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:07,340
And it

33
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:16,370
playpen.

34
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:27,440
And in order to see this we need not to be always open the file using the command prompt.

35
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:36,840
We can also open the files of it to see and thoughts are results residing.

36
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:48,210
So let's see if we have ABC and then through the XTi we have for Apple for banana for sure.

37
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:51,960
So when it snows it and go to the court again

38
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,900
then we have done this.

39
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:10,880
So let's come out and in order to all get this we have to use

40
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,760
buy in board.

41
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:24,970
I so it's so important for us from those in both

42
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:33,600
eyes it said.

43
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:40,970
And now let's open the fire.

44
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:51,260
Would just call the food or leave something else like that and just don't get any of the fires.

45
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:53,230
We are saved.

46
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:57,000
And let's see what happens.

47
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:58,850
So we open

48
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:12,260
all this they said it bought the XP

49
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:20,000
and I will open this in right.

50
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,480
And as

51
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:38,050
it has again been Karma I have to open the other two was also that this was nice.

52
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:46,720
You see the XTi and I'm opening it in the default mode.

53
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:56,240
Since I don't have to write anything into that I just want to read that and the other one open

54
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:03,800
fire fruit's the XTi

55
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:15,150
ass f I just forgot to add if one here

56
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,460
as one.

57
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:25,980
And after that I just want to you do this.

58
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:28,540
For that I am using for

59
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:33,230
four.

60
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:35,190
This is the all

61
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:46,280
no let's index Ofex but I just want to get to rid of that since I didn't want that right now for

62
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:55,180
Line 1 for my line do

63
00:07:59,240 --> 00:07:59,500
see

64
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:12,510
in basis I just want to boss this F1 and F2 since we are opening it as opening a Boosey as if Wonderfalls

65
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:14,070
S S2.

66
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:29,540
So if one or more if two last goaland and then we want you all can get it for that.

67
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:33,690
That's right.

68
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:47,820
We just start adding space for both of them so that we have a format like this.

69
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,770
And after that

70
00:08:54,010 --> 00:09:04,530
Dauth format your format like that format and in basis the half line one

71
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,220
group

72
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:14,730
this is a function.

73
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:35,320
And also all my lines do all off-Strip.

74
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:43,780
So we have our family or the now let's see what happens when it get run.

75
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:48,020
So just go with the terminal and run this again.

76
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:54,390
And now let's go to the files and we have this rest of the XTi and just open it.

77
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:58,760
Yeah we got a foot apple before banana and seafood chili.

78
00:09:58,820 --> 00:09:59,620
That's it.

79
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:07,340
That's how we could get a fire under fire and make a new one.

80
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:18,100
And where the fires are not affected by doing so they are asked like before.

81
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:23,460
So that's all the boat can get to needing a fire.

82
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:25,090
Oh.

83
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:28,780
So that's all for now.

84
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:29,700
Keep watching.

85
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,280
Thank you.
