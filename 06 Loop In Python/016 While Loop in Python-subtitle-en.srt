1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:01,890
Hire one.

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:09,870
Now let's have a look at why those invited and why loop statement in Python programming language repeatedly

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,470
executes that statement.

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:21,250
As long as a given condition is true and the syntax of why loop is like this.

5
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:24,270
Why then the expression

6
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:33,840
statements

7
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:43,480
and you might be wondering what his boss was eased as statement.

8
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:46,460
Which do nothing.

9
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:58,250
So if we want to declare a function all we want to write a law and if we want to do nothing then we

10
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:06,590
can just use this POS like here and now I will get rid of this because I just want to do something in

11
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:12,350
this Lew and so that he'll leave statement.

12
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:20,750
Maybe a single statement for a block of statements and the expression on the condition may be any expression

13
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:24,540
and true is any known zero value.

14
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:32,570
The loop iterates while the condition is true and when the condition becomes false the program control

15
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:36,650
passes to the line immediately following the loop.

16
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:46,230
Now let's have a look at the flow diagram of why this is the flow diagram of why.

17
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:59,990
And here we will check for the expression here and if it is true then the conditional called will get

18
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:10,280
executed and after that we will check for the result and if the condition is again true then conditional

19
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,650
code will be executed.

20
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:22,710
And this will continue to do until the condition here becomes thoughts and if the condition is force

21
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:29,800
the program through will go to the very next line of code.

22
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:36,460
Here we keep going all the while loop is that the loop might not.

23
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:44,630
And when the condition is disturbed and so does force the loop more the baby skipped and the first statement

24
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:54,820
after the while loop will be executed so that the Y is also our last entry loop.

25
00:02:55,140 --> 00:03:01,770
This is the condition here is false at the beginning says.

26
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:07,920
Then the program flow will not get into the loop.

27
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:18,600
And likewise all the half and exceed lobola so that this card do a loop and above the while loop.

28
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:21,410
We will be discussing in upcoming new deals.

29
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:25,340
So now let's have a look good an example.

30
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:42,880
So for that I will get rid of this loads and I want to declare a variable count equals zero then I just

31
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:47,810
want to look through it with an expression

32
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:59,390
count less than 5.

33
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:12,060
I just want to bring the count and after that I just won't be sure that the way you get exceeded.

34
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:22,510
And for that I also want to bring a string which is just like good bye or something like that.

35
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:34,020
And I just want to get rid of this boss here and I would just save this and let's go to the terminal

36
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:41,460
and run this program by David IDN.

37
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:50,990
What's happening or just I just for go to increment.

38
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:52,960
That's why it's happening.

39
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:56,050
And it is an infinite loop.

40
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,730
Seems the ground is equal to zero.

41
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:08,030
And the why can these less than five it will always bring the.

42
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:14,230
And in order to get out of the loop just get on board and see.

43
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:19,660
And it shows keyboard interrupted.

44
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:35,960
Just go to the code find out something like gun equals going plus one then it will show the actual doesn't

45
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:46,780
like this zero up before and when will the count equals five.

46
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:51,880
The condition becomes false and this will get out of this loop.

47
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:57,530
And the problem can really go to the next line and it will print goodbye.

48
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:07,100
And in the first case we had a sign it was only an infinite loop because of the condition inside this

49
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,730
White loop.

50
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:14,850
These are the two like I want or something like that.

51
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:23,430
So any non-zero value inside this way can make an infinite loop.

52
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:27,030
So that's all about y loops and by then.

53
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,920
So keep watching.

54
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:29,380
Thank you.
