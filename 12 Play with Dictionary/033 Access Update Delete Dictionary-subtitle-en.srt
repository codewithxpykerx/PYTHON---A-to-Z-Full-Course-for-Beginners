1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:09,700
In this field you are going to talk about how to access how to update and how to deal the dictionary

2
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:17,960
now first how to access the venue in a dictionary.

3
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:21,760
For that you have to create our dictionary.

4
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:29,700
So I needed a dictionary and a signing for a new career in the dictionary.

5
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:41,610
So now I'm going to print the news using all this credit but I get into this crap and I get in 2007.

6
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,700
This is this.

7
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,050
So here I am on this model.

8
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:58,400
The good old iPhone which is searching the new iPhone is associated with this key and this is after

9
00:00:58,410 --> 00:00:59,920
that grade.

10
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:01,380
This is Jim.

11
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:13,380
And now I'm going to turn the key 2000 mine which is these going on this month do we get the old iPhone

12
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:26,950
3G S which is just similar to this I'm not going to the key which is just an iPhone 4 which is just

13
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,010
similar to this.

14
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:38,340
The searching I from cool and has more to do with are just to dump them down because they didn't do

15
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:44,060
that do 2000 then associated with this is jinglin.

16
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:49,910
So you can use anything to add to the item from dictionary.

17
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:56,360
Now let's move to the next topic how to update the dictionary.

18
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:59,500
For that we have to get our dictionary.

19
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:02,080
So here I get a dictionary.

20
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:06,890
Signing for beer instead of the color is.

21
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:16,780
And now I'm going to update the game beer which is already exist in this dictionary.

22
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:19,510
So here I put it.

23
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:29,590
And I signed up 2007 and now I'm going to give different this to me just by time.

24
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:40,500
And after that it seemed to bring them up to the dictionary and there's more do we get the result as

25
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:47,880
we see the big havinga the new iPhone 3G which is similar to this.

26
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,050
Loving it.

27
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:55,990
And the next day we have to do as I can fool and lost.

28
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:06,280
You can see the 2007 heading for new which is a distinct item which means that the key to those timing

29
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:10,160
is did they put up another string.

30
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:18,330
So there is a way to update the game in the beer which is already exist in the dictionary.

31
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:26,210
So now I'm going to add a new beer in the dictionary.

32
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:34,960
Next I'm going to update the halting action which means that I'm going to add some beer and sceptered

33
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,360
dictionary.

34
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:41,160
So Third you have to assign a new key here.

35
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:48,060
I put 2000 11 which is a new key in this dictionary.

36
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:55,130
And I move to a different level word.

37
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:58,920
Now I'm going to do this more do.

38
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:06,050
Perhaps you can see those 11 is added in the dictionary.

39
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:09,770
So these are the two of the.

40
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:13,960
These are all about or updating the dictionary.

41
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:22,720
Let's move to the topic how to do the game from the dictionary.

42
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:26,590
For that to create a dictionary.

43
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:34,340
So here I created a dictionary and signing for give it to you and the dictionary.

44
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:47,340
And no I don't believe the e-mail we're using came in so that you beat me and my third and here the

45
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,810
name of the dictionary.

46
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,780
And that's quite a record.

47
00:04:51,120 --> 00:05:01,530
I'm going to give the name of the game which is put on the seven and after that was simply the updated

48
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:06,940
diction and so here we get that is all.

49
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:16,680
So that being said the only basis on the team given new year with me is that the game of problem solving

50
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,540
is delayed.

51
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:28,020
There's a part of the game going to be using the game that is all about deleting the item from dictionary.
