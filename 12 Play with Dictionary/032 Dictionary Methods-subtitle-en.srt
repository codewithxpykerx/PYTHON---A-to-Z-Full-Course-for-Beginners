1
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:08,310
In this medium we're going to talk about some really didn't matter which I use the dictionary.

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:17,380
The first letter is a lengthy letter the Lennon-McCartney simply we don't know the number of item or

3
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:23,640
the number of people here which are exist in the dictionary.

4
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,790
So first we have to create our dictionary.

5
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:34,250
So here I created a dictionary as I know some believe in the dictionary.

6
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:40,880
And now I'm moving to the left of this dictionary.

7
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:47,140
I put in an instead the prentices and it put me in.

8
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:49,260
Which is a dictionary.

9
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:59,590
Here we are in this model and we get it for because we have four beer in this direction.

10
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:00,980
So these are all about.

11
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,710
Let me turn the next letter is.

12
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:05,790
My card.

13
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:13,750
The third is simply to the end of the envelope here which are existe and center dictionary.

14
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:16,670
So I heard a caller playing her.

15
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:20,750
No I'm going to read the dictionary.

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,020
So here being here is a

17
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:32,780
preserved in the dictionary because the items are clear using this clear weather.

18
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:42,750
So it is all about my kind of the next letter is the letter a copy of my third used to copy the item

19
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:45,400
which exist inside the dictionary.

20
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:49,290
So here I could get her duple variable B.

21
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:53,560
Now I'm going to copy the next day.

22
00:01:53,760 --> 00:02:04,290
I don't see why we mattered which means that this dictionary is copying the new variable B.

23
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:10,090
And now I'm going to create the dictionary B.

24
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:13,150
So here it is.

25
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:18,470
So how do you get these are the same as you see in the dictionary.

26
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:27,360
Because this dictionary in its copy with a variable A B B G A B is a newly created dictionary having

27
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,760
the same value you we're still all about r.p.m.

28
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:43,810
the next time I don't either get ready or get my third return value for the given key if a key is in

29
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:47,970
north and then it will get done.

30
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:54,430
So for that I'm going to grade the value the time or the

31
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:06,020
propels it in you know we don't just want to do it here we get results.

32
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:08,380
I point to the the stream.

33
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:13,370
So seeing this proposal it key associated with this string.

34
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:18,000
I clearly now listing to them another key to

35
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:27,150
four letter than this one you begin going because it runs down.

36
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:37,890
Because this iPhone 4 is associated with this village rather than it is all about to get I heard the

37
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:45,470
national anthem and either I don't know I heard this and I third it on listo dictionary having a game

38
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,320
when do you know doubles form.

39
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:52,040
So from there we have a dictionary called me.

40
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:58,790
Now I'm going to simply print the items top items.

41
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:05,000
Here we get the result in the top of the form.

42
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:10,780
You see all the people appear in parentheses.

43
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:16,650
Which means that we use doubles and all the items are in the upper tier.

44
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:20,010
It is all about the items method.

45
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:30,240
The next one third is or isn't after the kids letter becomes our list of all the 11 there in the dictionary

46
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:40,110
that we have a dictionary called B and insert the dictionary so you will be ours and I'm going to simply

47
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:52,730
read all the Brennus in thought he might as I call this method get you right as now on this morning.

48
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:58,600
So here we get the result right on the nine and seven.

49
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:03,190
So these four items are key in this dictionary.

50
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,270
So is all about the method.

51
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:11,800
The next letter is update letter the other day.

52
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:16,610
My third I used to add two or more to the dictionary.

53
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:20,280
And after that you would get the updated results.

54
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:26,370
So here I go is having a variable B and B.

55
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:33,930
Now I'm going to get the dictionary using this dictionary will be for that.

56
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:43,510
We have to use it or abrogate my third and instead the president his I put my name b afraid that is

57
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:45,090
simply wrong.

58
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:48,740
The updated X to the it is a.

59
00:05:49,740 --> 00:06:00,350
So here we get the result in the updated form because initially we have only 4 item in said dictionary.

60
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,330
And after that I updated the dictionary.

61
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:08,140
We have 8 items as we see in this output.

62
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,420
So these are all out.

63
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:16,830
Updated my third of the last 20 odd benches method.

64
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:24,480
The Vellis method simply written down all those values which are exist in the dictionary.

65
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,730
So I'm going to simply read all the values using this method.

66
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:34,980
Here is a dictionary and order and then is the other.

67
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:37,790
So I call the values method.

68
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:46,500
So here with this more do we get the result Hagar's Hegazy you get the all values from the dictionary

69
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:47,430
in.

70
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:52,590
These are all about Windows and these are all about the dictionary.

71
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:53,250
You can.
