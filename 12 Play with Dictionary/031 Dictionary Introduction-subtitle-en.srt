1
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:11,200
Come to the right thing to do here today to discuss about our dictionary by our dictionary is only to

2
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:15,430
be done just like in list.

3
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:25,020
If you know what the Oxford Dictionary is or any dictionary is then what we see in the Oxford Dictionary

4
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:31,110
is that there is an outside world and these words have some meanings.

5
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:44,400
So by the time we have Oxford like dictionaries instead of words we have to show that we have revenue

6
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:45,930
and we

7
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:53,460
revenues are separated.

8
00:00:53,500 --> 00:01:00,350
We them and yet there are so bitterly cold on.

9
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:10,300
The main difference between a dictionary and most peoples is that instead of being numbers that they

10
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:19,300
don't do anything much worse that when one group acts the item from the list was

11
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,470
made.

12
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:31,970
But in which they can use a pen just like Stroom character numbers.

13
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:35,000
So this is all about our study.

14
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:36,710
I'm just on to something.

15
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:37,260
So

16
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:45,740
I hope I shall do the.

17
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:52,170
So for that you're over I know some I don't.

18
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:56,680
So I'm going to because we don't have any.

19
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:11,270
I said This makes many are presumed And the reason for this is the first item here is 2007.

20
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:12,730
Hello.

21
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:16,910
So just to tell you something.

22
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:22,930
This is a new center.

23
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:29,980
When you put some item just to tell you.

24
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:36,600
And so this this is associated

25
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:50,740
with has been that there are so many items now.

26
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:59,810
I'm going to get it done so here I put the square back yard.

27
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:04,040
I could do something good.

28
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:06,110
Hello.

29
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:15,530
Hello my new which is associated with this game seven is all about the dictionary actually by time.
