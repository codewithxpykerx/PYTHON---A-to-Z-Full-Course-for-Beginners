00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:08,550
Welcome to the Python tutorial today we are going to talk about more youth in python modules in Python

2
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:18,270
simply python files with extension which contains sort of function which means that your model file

3
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:25,220
will always contain different function and these functions are used in another file.

4
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,140
We use them more.

5
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:33,930
You could break down large put them into small manageable files so if we define our most use function

6
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:39,640
in a module and we import it by using import keyword.

7
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:46,110
So now let's move to the examples of models here.

8
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:55,360
I just opened a folder with the empty folder and now I'm going to get a module file in this folder for

9
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:55,660
that

10
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:08,790
engaged module file which is another way.

11
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:14,450
And now I'm going to create a function that is more dual.

12
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:23,480
So for that we have to use the Internet and give the name of the function we just press and insert the

13
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,850
function as simply pre-testing we do.

14
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,450
I from what do

15
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,270
they serve this function.

16
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:42,970
And now I'm going to create another file which is or is not a file.

17
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:55,230
You can give any name to this but it is a file here.

18
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,920
I just get rid of modify and or interface.

19
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,720
Or is what I used to do.

20
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:09,000
Or you can say that all the function from this one do we just do another beba.

21
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:18,150
And now I'm going to use import keyword to import the function from this more do so simply import the

22
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:19,120
module first.

23
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:23,100
We just do not and this is our name of the model.

24
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:30,480
And after that I will simply call the function by using the name of the model which is doing not are

25
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:35,950
first we simply run this model.

26
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,640
We get the result I am from want do.

27
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:45,080
So this is a method when we call the models in sympathetically.

28
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:50,220
So we have another method to import Ahmadu in different directory.

29
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:57,750
So if you want to access the module file in any degrees or defended agree then we have to create the

30
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:04,780
model in the site because this site is located in our Python installed dedicatory.

31
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:15,490
I'm going to open up by Tanstaafl that actually here in local type See your local FC user name of the

32
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:24,180
user in standard Aberdare dong loken for that program.

33
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:27,950
Then by then are defined to do here.

34
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:35,330
We just open up by to install dedicatory and insert that we have a folder called Live and inside the

35
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,630
lib rehabber site packages folder.

36
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:45,730
So here I just will Burnetts I begged this folder and instead I'm going to create a module file.

37
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:51,500
So here and what I viewed or more do I mean

38
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:58,040
more to do first don't be very

39
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:09,090
Instead this modified and when to be a simple function which you done.

40
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:09,620
Mr.

41
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:21,800
side

42
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:32,320
is this function.

43
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,740
Instead it's more do.

44
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,320
So are we ever more do you more do it faster.

45
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:40,080
And instead the more do we have a function name.

46
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:45,280
Hello and now I'm going to call this more to do from another that.

47
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,400
So here we go.

48
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,420
The dog went for dinner and now I want to.

49
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:55,820
What he's in five which is right.

50
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:57,520
More Dieu.

51
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:00,500
Don't you worry.

52
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:07,130
And incentives what is.

53
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:10,470
I'm going to call them what do you want.

54
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:13,610
You will import more and do

55
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,610
what you want doing first.

56
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:28,780
And now I'm going to call a function which we have created in them what do you

57
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:36,370
have in this.

58
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:41,590
What do they get that isn't it just from sight bankers.

59
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:47,900
So this hour another method when you call them or do something and then that is the one more thing.

60
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:56,300
When you create a model in our site packages then you can call them model in any day in your computer.

61
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:59,770
So this is all about more do in by Python.
