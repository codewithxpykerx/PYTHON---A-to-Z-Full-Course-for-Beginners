1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:08,630
The next to my third is it was my third but it was my third simply reverse the item from the list.

2
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:18,690
So now I'm going to get a list for now I'm going to simply reverse the I don't even reverse now I'm

3
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:25,050
going to simply print the updated will which is the reverse items.

4
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:25,850
So how do we get.

5
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:27,880
That is Evelyn.

6
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:34,080
As you can see the first inexpertly which is zero is started from 34.

7
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:43,050
And this initial We knew the first index we knew is a 167 which means that the items are reversed.

8
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,030
So this is all about the what's the matter.
