1
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:07,270
Go to my third year Doan's I don't how many times repeated in sarod the list.

2
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:11,210
So for that I initially created a list for the same list.

3
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:18,060
Now I want to attribute some I don't which is 1 6 7 and 23 and 23.

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,700
So here I'm going to count the reglue 23.

5
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:23,750
So you don't

6
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:28,820
get three

7
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:33,010
Freydon this more deal.

8
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:36,330
So how do we get less than three.

9
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:42,260
Because this going to triva a new repeated three times inside of this list.

10
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:45,380
So simply called method really don't you.

11
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:49,600
I don't which are repeated inside the Lisp.
