1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:08,790
The next math third is index my third index my third most important one the inexpert knew of the existing

2
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:09,390
idea.

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:16,910
So now I initially created a seamless and now I'm going to find the next brand new all this item.

4
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:27,440
So for that head I put it toward the index and now I'm going to bed though we're new in this next month.

5
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:30,800
But now I'm going to this more Bill.

6
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,800
So how did we get this old one.

7
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:38,670
Because the next version of this item is one because the only way out of this item is zero.

8
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:41,620
This is one this is two this is three.

9
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,690
And this is for.
