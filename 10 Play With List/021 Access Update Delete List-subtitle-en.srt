1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:05,110
So now I'm going to access the item from the list.

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:09,220
So here I collected the list assigning some item.

3
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:12,530
The first item is a mystery.

4
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:14,930
The second item is a fraud.

5
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:17,430
Well you hair.

6
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:23,350
I'm with the actors the I don't know having the expedition 0.

7
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:33,260
So for that you have to give the index when you show the head of the disorder and get the result by

8
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:35,230
10 which is a string.

9
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:40,240
So these are all about the accessing the value from the list.

10
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:48,720
So another second think is that how to update the list updating the list means that we have to change

11
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:51,750
the item we have of did this item.

12
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:55,840
So initially we didn't want to come in said the list.

13
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,580
And the second item is flawed will you.

14
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:08,600
So now I'm going to change this floor will look with some industry so for that I'm going to using our

15
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:21,710
next a new one and assigning a string to her hello and now I'm going to print this whole Jane.

16
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:26,310
So here we get the result we have to item the first item in this tree.

17
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:28,950
And the second item is the updated string.

18
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:32,420
So initially we have floatable Lou.

19
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:41,190
And after that we have a string with which is hello could is all about updating the list.

20
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:49,990
So the next thing is how to delete the list deleting the list and how to move the list.

21
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:55,380
So for that we have to use a method D.

22
00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:01,940
And now I'm again using the expedition's of one.

23
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:13,360
So I'm going to lead this item into question 1 and after that I'm going to print the list so here we

24
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,470
get the result.

25
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,960
So how do we get there isn't only one item.

26
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:23,140
Because the second item is deleted using the b l method.

27
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:28,530
So this is all about the accessing deleting and updating the list.
