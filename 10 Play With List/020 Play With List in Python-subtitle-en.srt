00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:09,550
Welcome to the white and do even today we're going to talk about live in by then the list is in which

2
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:18,530
you do that I mean by time which I used to store our list of item list is created using a square to

3
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:25,070
record and each item placed inside the list with separate coalmines.

4
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:29,370
I don't insert the list have their own index relative.

5
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:35,700
That means that each item in the list had their own position which is denoted by.

6
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:37,580
So these are new.

7
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:41,920
Now let us understand to a simple example of list.

8
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:48,320
I open up my pencil and now I'm going to with some simple example of Mr..

9
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,100
So initially I created it very well.

10
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:59,430
And that's I think the list I see that list is created using is quite a bit good.

11
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:04,520
So the emptiness because we don't have any item inside this list.

12
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:11,730
So now I'm going to assign some item in this list to the first I don't use a string.

13
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:14,640
The second I don't use a can do that right.

14
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:19,920
You thought I don't know it's true but something does have a new.

15
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:23,000
Which is the alphanumeric menu.

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,430
So I'm going to print this list to.

17
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:35,230
So here we get the result of this list which isn't good.

18
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:39,320
It's you can do that there the many Benue.

19
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:44,370
But this is all about this in my turn.

20
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:52,720
Next I'm going to explain to you how to access the menu then send the list how to observe the list and

21
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,480
how to delete the list.
