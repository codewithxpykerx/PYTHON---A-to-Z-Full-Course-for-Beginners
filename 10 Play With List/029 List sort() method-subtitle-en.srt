1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:08,210
The last third is sort of my third sort my third of it simply sort of the item from the list which means

2
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:13,020
that begins on the idea of either increasing or decreasing order.

3
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:15,140
Now I'm going to start the item.

4
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,000
So here I created a list.

5
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:21,130
Now I'm going to simply sort this list.

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:29,360
Now I'm going to print the updated list with the.

7
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:35,550
So here we get the result which is in increasing order which means that the first item is the lowest

8
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:40,830
I don't and the last I don't is the highest I don't have the larger value.

9
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:48,610
So if you want to get the value in decreasing order then it means simply that he was the sorting items

10
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:50,470
on each week.

11
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:57,660
This was trying to help me get the result in negating order.

12
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,940
So here we have two example.

13
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:05,240
This is in increasing order and this is in decreasing order of starting.
