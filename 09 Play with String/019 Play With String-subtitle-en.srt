00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:07,560
Welcome to the Python tutorial today we're going to talk about string in Python.

2
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:14,460
String is a set of character or we can say that the string is a collection of character represented

3
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:18,040
in a single court order double code.

4
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:21,090
So now let us understand to a simple example.

5
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:27,890
Here I open up by person and now I'm going to get as good some example after that I explain you

6
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:31,520
personally.

7
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:40,010
They presented a string and double called So here we get the result which is a string value.

8
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:45,420
So now again I'm going to give the same well-doing single code.

9
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:51,240
So we get the same value as we get in the previous value.

10
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,710
So these are all about string.

11
00:00:53,730 --> 00:01:01,220
Now I'm going to explain you some method which are used in string for the first method is the capitalized

12
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:09,790
third capitalized method rewritten the same history but the only difference is that it will return a

13
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:12,880
capital as the first character.

14
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:15,280
So postulate execute this method

15
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:24,340
so firstly you have to create a string for their Hello world

16
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:32,000
and I'm going to call the capitalized method.

17
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:38,020
You don't capitalize.

18
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:39,100
So here we get the result.

19
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:39,950
Hello world.

20
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:44,890
You can see the difference between this and the word and this Helliwell where the edge is capital.

21
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,920
And the answer is hello.

22
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,750
That is a small capitalized method.

23
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:53,500
Let's give you the first character in capital.

24
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,370
So it is all about capitalized method.

25
00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:06,890
The second method is the method gone method is used to a character inside the collection of actors for

26
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:09,490
that when to give the.

27
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:12,300
Well Lou at the end.

28
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,050
Hello.

29
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:15,540
That's what we do.

30
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:21,190
And again I'm going to print the value your door.

31
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:32,070
See you in the to count and which will leave you up to code and giving it the.

32
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:33,750
So here we get the result.

33
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:40,560
Do you mean that it is to insert this whole string here.

34
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:41,560
Easy ones.

35
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,930
And the second is here.

36
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,250
So these are all out to count.

37
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:48,820
My third gunmetal will simply count the character.

38
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:55,730
The next method is a Find method find a method used to find the index position of character.

39
00:02:55,730 --> 00:03:07,680
So now execute this program and assigning a value which is owned by Stanistreet and when to find be

40
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:11,230
inserted by Peniston.

41
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:19,860
So you don't find earned human activity.

42
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,750
So here we get the result too.

43
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:26,250
So detector is in the index position of two.

44
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:28,120
So P is inverted 0.

45
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:29,510
Why isn't one.

46
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,110
And Deeson do.

47
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:35,780
So the find character will give you the next position on the character.

48
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:38,660
The next method is alphanumeric method.

49
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,750
The alphanumeric method will return either true or false.

50
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,040
If your string contents alphanumeric values are unknown.

51
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:56,230
So for that I'm getting ready as I need to string which is hello after that and then to give some dessert

52
00:03:56,490 --> 00:04:06,340
after that again and when to write hello or now to print the alphanumeric values so that you don't I

53
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:11,350
s d l and you m.

54
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:18,810
So here we go to the desert to which Muenster our history contains the alphabet X as well as disease.

55
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:21,260
Well you said indeed the Velu.

56
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:31,430
So these are all about alphanumeric Billoo the next method is is Alfar method that is open method will

57
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,670
return you either true or false.

58
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:38,570
If your story contains the alphabet or not.

59
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:49,000
So for that I'm when to say if I were adding value which just hello or not and print this condition

60
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:54,860
your daughter is ill be it is alpha.

61
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:55,550
So here we go.

62
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:56,100
No.

63
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:56,780
2.

64
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:06,960
So if I if I'm going to give the hello with one two three and deliver a new it can simply give you the

65
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,440
fourth

66
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,940
because these are strong.

67
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:17,330
Also condoms are indeed available.

68
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:26,160
So these are all about or is Ulfar method the next method is a digital method deject method will give

69
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,720
you either true or false.

70
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:33,450
Depend upon your history contains some character or some business.

71
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:44,440
So for that when to initially give a certain good 3:03 for desert and not ending up in the condition

72
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:49,780
your daughter is did it.

73
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:54,770
So here we go and that was all because I was in Grenadines only a digital value.

74
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:58,240
So these is all about the digital method.

75
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:04,620
The next method is lenth my third lenth and a third will give you the length of characters.

76
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:23,950
Hayse the string are now and when to print the length of character and and and in.

77
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,170
So here we get the result 13.

78
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:33,660
So here we count 1 2 3 4 5 6 and the virus is 7 8 9 10.

79
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:37,500
Well today it is all about the lenth character.

80
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:46,500
The next method is a the method no one method will give you the lower value.

81
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:49,250
If you give some random characters.

82
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:53,800
So if I'm going to give some relief as we are I

83
00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:08,320
hello world blues get Pradel and all characters are small if you play the hello way

84
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:14,460
Dorte or even the odd.

85
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:20,180
So how do we get the desired all the characters in the smaller to even the Doebbler is also a smaller

86
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:20,670
dose.

87
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:24,910
So it is all about the legitimatized the next Metallica.

88
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:33,910
But I guess my third guess method really give you the non-job character which means that it will give

89
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:35,620
you the capital value.

90
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:49,450
So if came the same hello world string and green the relevant upright

91
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:55,520
so how do we get the results.

92
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,180
All the actor in the capital form.

93
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,780
So it is all about the apprentice method.

94
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:07,590
The next method is a step Kismat a third step this method is used to Sebha the string.

95
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:15,190
It means that if you give the small actor it was simply swept into the capital character or if you give

96
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:18,930
the capital act it would convert it into the small character.

97
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:29,390
So for that hearing will give the character well character Hello world and now and then to exit this

98
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:38,550
print or now you is done with ISTEP case.

99
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:44,250
Harry get all look at it in a small letter.

100
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,660
So if we give the we're in

101
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:50,690
small letters

102
00:08:55,740 --> 00:09:06,840
or in this don't ask is SEPIC here we get all the character in character form.

103
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:09,680
So this is all about the swep guess method.

104
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:15,210
The next method is Mxs method Mxs method will do don't you.

105
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:20,750
The maximum is a drink actor in the collection of character to be considered the stream.

106
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:23,630
So for that equal to

107
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:30,570
Hello World.

108
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:40,240
Now I'm going to exit the next get it to X and so heavy get the result that gives the largest character

109
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,440
in this string.

110
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,060
So this is all about the next guy.

111
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:47,120
Excellent.

112
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:49,950
I didn't say that Mxs method.

113
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:52,360
The next method is a min method.

114
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:58,380
When method is used to get a minimum correct value in say the string.

115
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:01,430
So for that I'm going to give some.

116
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:08,570
Doing well which is by 10 and I'm going to print them minimum leverage and Min.

117
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:10,400
So here we get the desired edge.

118
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,630
So the minimum character insert this is doing.

119
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:20,800
So these are all about the min method the last method is the placement third placement third this in

120
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,130
blue.

121
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:27,010
He plays that character and he's really greater screen named by them.

122
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:33,780
Now I'm going to replace the Python for you don't

123
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:40,230
please and we've got a place to be today.

124
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:45,840
So the b's the on list character of a new.

125
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:51,690
And does the new value have a word that is a limit to the Zayton.

126
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:56,050
Which means that B is the best way to read it.

127
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:57,630
The best way.

128
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:00,900
So it is all about the history.

129
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:01,780
In Python.
