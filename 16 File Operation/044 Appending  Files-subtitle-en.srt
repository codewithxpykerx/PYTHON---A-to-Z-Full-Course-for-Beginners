1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:06,250
In this video we are going to learn how to open data in our existing files.

2
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:15,080
So while we use append instead of right when we use the Mukhlas or we can say w for writing the data

3
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:18,190
then the existent would have been deleted.

4
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:26,990
Then we create a new data but then we use the mode then the new data is added after the existing data.

5
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:36,410
So here we already have something you know quite extreme which is I'm from bison and I'm going to append

6
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:49,690
some data using email which is and now just and just to see does more do or more new here.

7
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:56,980
I'm going to search something with just chrome Indio.

8
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:05,610
Just click onto my Kirchner to get the text for just right under DXi.

9
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:08,160
Here you can see there is another.

10
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:08,800
Did I just.

11
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:15,710
I'm from India which is rendered after the existing data which is I'm from python.

12
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,940
And now when me use w here

13
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,320
just to run this morning you are going wrote something.

14
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,280
Hello world.

15
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:34,620
Just clicked into the file which is why it's under 60

16
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:42,860
so you can see a new do they generated and exit Sundari deleted.

17
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:48,410
That's why we don't use w I think some data we always use our print.

18
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:55,290
I do indeed because deathblow will delete the existing data and it will create a new reader but when

19
00:01:55,290 --> 00:02:00,790
we use append mode then the new the devil added after the existing data.

20
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:06,390
So this is the way to add some data on the now file using byte script.
