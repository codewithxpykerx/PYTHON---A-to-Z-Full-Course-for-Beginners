00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,130
Welcome to them why can't you do it.

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:10,180
Today we are going to loan file handling in Boston which means that how to create file using Python

3
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:15,190
script and how to make some data in text file using byte in the script.

4
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:21,340
So now let's move to the first topic which is how to create a text file using brighteners script.

5
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,490
So here I just open up writing a script.

6
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:28,580
So here just click file click new file.

7
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:35,480
And here we have a new script just to save this script in dextro

8
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,790
or named Regis file.

9
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:48,480
Don't be like So here you can see there is a script which is file that we like.

10
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:56,180
And now I'm going to create a text file using my script to just write a variable which is fine.

11
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:59,820
You can give any name to this variable after that.

12
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:04,740
Just write a function which is open and inside the open function.

13
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:12,510
If you pass some emitter so the first emitter is the name of the file which is right and the extreme.

14
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,640
You can give any name to this file.

15
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:20,090
And after that you have to put a format of the file with this text file.

16
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:26,990
And after the parameter just put a comma after the comma we put a mod.

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,350
So there are four or five modes.

18
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:33,280
So the first mode is a real mode which is used to read the file.

19
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:36,190
Second what is the right man would you use to write the file.

20
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,520
And the third one is the Brennaman.

21
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,580
So apparently used to Edita you know existing file.

22
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:46,970
So here I'm going to use the right word to create a text file.

23
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:49,850
So I just put w after the W.

24
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:56,870
I have to put a plus sign to this blessing in disguise that if there is a file in a pod.

25
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,800
So just use those file to write something.

26
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:04,670
And if there is no file in the part then just create a file.

27
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,350
Each name is white and or text.

28
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:10,170
So here I'm going to use are the bluebloods.

29
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:17,490
If you move this plus sign so this the blue means you want to use a file which is already exist in the

30
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:18,010
box.

31
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:21,840
And after that you want to write something in the file.

32
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:29,690
So now you put plus here and now let's run this Mordieu thing is it's index error.

33
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:30,830
Sawston

34
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:42,810
So here we did not get any error just move to the next door to here you can see the text file whose

35
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:46,790
name is byte under the XP and into the text file.

36
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,050
There's no data.

37
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:52,200
So this is the process to create a file using brightener script.
