1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:05,490
In this world you're going to learn how to do better instead of fine.

2
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:09,610
But you can say how to create our data into the existing files.

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:17,320
So we had already created a file which is right under the XTi and now I'm going to use up right in the

4
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:21,650
script which is fine or B-Boy from Dexter.

5
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:22,890
Just click on file.

6
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,590
Just click on open click on desktop and click on finder.

7
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,290
Be right.

8
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:35,700
So here I am when I use debut we get used to what I define.

9
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:38,280
And now I'm going create a string.

10
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:44,220
Well just last year after that and would assign some interesting pitches.

11
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,350
Hello world.

12
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:53,710
So here the hello world is a string which is stored in the variable Astier.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,360
And now I'm going to use a function which is quite fine.

14
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:00,320
Right.

15
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:09,980
Instead the president says I'm going to use a variable which is Astier this hello world is a store inside

16
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:11,010
this function.

17
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:18,780
Right after the fight to close this file using Glos function.

18
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,680
And now let's run this model.

19
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:24,850
So here we did not get any error.

20
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:28,320
So let's move to the file which is 560.

21
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,190
Just open it.

22
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:33,960
So here you can see the string which is hello world.

23
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:40,520
So this is the way to get all data in your file using bytes and script.

24
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:46,990
And now I'm going to do this data received this and just close this

25
00:01:50,260 --> 00:02:01,100
inaugurates will do that by conscript and here I'm going to change something which is still your input.

26
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:09,440
And so in good story duchies and some data

27
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:23,250
or non-Arabs from this Mordieu.

28
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:26,800
Now I'm going to write some to choose from

29
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:39,880
by to just click do no search for the files just by you can read.

30
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:47,530
And here you can see de-listing which is I'm from Brighton which we had typed you know Batan script.

31
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,520
So this is the way to create a data using by Pennis script.
