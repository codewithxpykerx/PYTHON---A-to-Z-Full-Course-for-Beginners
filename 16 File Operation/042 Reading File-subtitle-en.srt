00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:02,040
Hi everyone.

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:06,500
Now let's have a look good reading from a flat to read the content of a file.

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:12,270
We must open the file and read more that our readers murders are available for this book was we can

4
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:16,700
use the read would side another or just read mother or any other mothers.

5
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:21,450
We will be discussing in this session later to do this.

6
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:25,750
So in the first case the read with Cyzon either.

7
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:37,830
We are reading up to the size of the sites but Amida mentioned and it will return after that size of

8
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:39,760
data to us.

9
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:49,290
And if the size barometer is not specified it reads and returns up to the end of the line.

10
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:52,100
So let's go to the terminal.

11
00:00:52,940 --> 00:01:02,600
And since I have or some of the lines in my desk be XTi which we saved previously.

12
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:07,580
I just want to get through that get be.

13
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:15,390
I just think the second line to second line and third line de-code line and remove the Portlock in order

14
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:21,320
to do something with the read operations with the files.

15
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:24,690
We just want to go to the White then on

16
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:41,090
and now just open the file in read mode for that f equal to open with in court.

17
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:42,240
Best to be XTi

18
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:49,100
forma.

19
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:52,630
The mother read.

20
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:04,820
Now I just want to pass the syce that I need to read read plie first.

21
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:08,080
And this filter don't up to the character.

22
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,740
1 2 3 4 5.

23
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,210
Get it all up.

24
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:22,040
And if I did it again then it will return from the blank line and one two three four.

25
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:31,030
And now I just want to get rid of this size character size but I only disagree then it will turn up

26
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:34,360
to the end of the fight.

27
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:35,190
So

28
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:46,200
now I just want to know the file position for that.

29
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,100
I just want to write.

30
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:54,580
If not then this will return the current file.

31
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:59,380
Now if these at the end of the file would you still eat.

32
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:09,170
If I just want to bring the file closer to the initial position I can do anything door seek and it said

33
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:14,090
that Sudol And ief.

34
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:19,180
I will ask to bell the current file position.

35
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:25,540
This will return to and read the end file.

36
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:38,160
Once we move on to plain f nobody and this will read the in depth like

37
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:45,580
we can read a file line by line using a for.

38
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:49,570
This is both efficient and fast.

39
00:03:49,700 --> 00:04:04,470
So in order to do that we just go to the initial position and we are looping it for line in F stacks

40
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:06,140
indentation here.

41
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:13,690
This day it's been like

42
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,450
this again this winter.

43
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:31,720
Line by line up to the end of the five then we can use a read line the other murdered to read individual

44
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:33,720
lines of a file.

45
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:40,010
This would be a fire till the new newly in building the newline character.

46
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:49,370
So in order to do that let's go to the bishop's position again and estilo threadlet

47
00:04:52,240 --> 00:05:00,860
and this is done the first line if we take the second line again the third.

48
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:14,710
And if you want to get all of a sudden then we can do f don't read lines instead of after like.

49
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:25,720
Now where we are at the end of the file so that if you list and in order to see what happens see to

50
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:26,740
see it all.

51
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:34,360
And now just do it again and this will return a list with all the lines.

52
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:43,180
So that's all about Reeg murdered in by then.

53
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:48,840
So the other mothers will be discussed in the other way to use.

54
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,110
So keep watching.

55
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:50,780
Thank you.
