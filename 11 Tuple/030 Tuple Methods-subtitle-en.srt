1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:11,730
In this video I'm going to explain some function which I used in Japan the first My third is lenth my

2
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:12,600
third.

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:21,350
This method will get the number man inserter especially when you consider it would give you the list

4
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:24,960
of items which exist in the handbook.

5
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:28,530
So we had to pick some example.

6
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,060
So I did a couple assigning some I don't.

7
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:36,920
Now I'm going to read to the left on this topic.

8
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:41,980
So here I am using Beldi and the third and I put a

9
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,530
right and there's more to

10
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,310
it isn't it.

11
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:53,160
Because we have it.

12
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:55,310
I don't intend this.

13
00:00:55,720 --> 00:01:05,380
So it is all about the length the next time my code is Max my third Max method don't you.

14
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:12,630
The element will have the max number that we have to create or double.

15
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:25,730
So here I it a couple I see some item and now I'm going to print some new way I use max method.

16
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,100
Hey I think it's going to do

17
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:30,810
heavy good.

18
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:40,150
The reason for the pain because in this double the I don't fuku bit I have done this badly.

19
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:43,020
So these is all about the max my target.

20
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:51,900
So then next my third minute third minute third just similar to the max method but it will simply be

21
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:52,740
done.

22
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:57,020
The minimum value from the top for that.

23
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,340
Could I use my method.

24
00:01:59,460 --> 00:01:59,830
Am I.

25
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:12,650
And had I done this more do Brigade-Major 34 because petfood is just consider this double is all about

26
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:21,030
the min my current the last my third is how to convert the copper to the next.

27
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:24,480
Or you can say how to convert the list into equal.

28
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:30,610
So first we're going to convert the items to list data.

29
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:33,630
So here I created a double.

30
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:36,230
We have some item in and this double.

31
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:41,050
Now I'm going to go into the list.

32
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,260
They get them it will be.

33
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:46,910
And now I want to use list here.

34
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:52,290
I will say that is this variable pay it either double.

35
00:02:52,380 --> 00:03:06,310
No I'm going to simply create the variable b k bigger an so here we see the items are enclosed in quite

36
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:10,760
a big card which means that these are the list item.

37
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:15,460
And now we can order item from list to open.

38
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:18,590
So first we have to create a list.

39
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:22,110
Here we have some item in the list.

40
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:27,320
And now I'm going to convert into the number I used.

41
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:30,000
I and that that it wouldn't be.

42
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:36,600
And now I'm going to use my third You B and B and I put in.

43
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,060
Which is a mistake.

44
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:43,300
Now I'm going to simply print it with B.

45
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:50,880
Harrigan these are the all items I enclosed within a band and this is.

46
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:55,150
Which means that these items are double items.

47
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:58,740
This is all about the double in white.
