1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:08,840
High everyone in this we are going to do an ASEAN which will incorporate the for loop range function.

2
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:12,850
And also IIF statement.

3
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:23,440
So in this example we are illustrating the combinational and as statement with the full statement that

4
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:28,750
search for prime numbers from 10 to 20.

5
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,680
So let's do that to.

6
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:39,610
And in order to do that first of all we have to iterate with we didn't get 20 for that.

7
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:44,420
Let's create a for loop for now.

8
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:50,650
Then doing

9
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,690
to iterate on the factors of the number.

10
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:01,480
Let's create a model for

11
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:12,320
do you know

12
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:18,580
that to determine the first factor.

13
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:19,730
Let's do

14
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,670
none more efficient.

15
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,540
I let's say that

16
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:40,080
right as I think the results do in East thinnish e.

17
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:59,530
Division I equal to zero then in order to calculate the second factor let's do g equals num divided

18
00:01:59,620 --> 00:01:59,820
by

19
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:03,840
and

20
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:13,540
let's put in all the three values in fashion like

21
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,880
then DGT

22
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:22,730
equals

23
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,310
G.

24
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:31,850
Indu post indeed the

25
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:42,580
add in person each then you recess.

26
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,090
No I'm not.

27
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,110
I will not.

28
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:55,580
G and this person is d e's get replaced by name which is an integer.

29
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:05,710
That's why this person is D and this HD is get replaced by this I Indu and it's d again which is replaced

30
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:06,790
by this G

31
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,540
and after that if statement

32
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:27,230
do more to the next nimble and then an end statement would just know be as of this.

33
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:27,830
Q

34
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,620
Yes just three

35
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:43,580
Colma he's right.

36
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:48,990
So that's it.

37
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:54,120
Let's see if we go to the terminal in order to see the is.

38
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:59,710
So in the Downloads directory.

39
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:05,580
Well the file are you resides and Thuan python

40
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:14,470
files you look at here print in this fashion

41
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:33,760
and this underdo term we know that this technique was to do indeed fly then.

42
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,690
Is it brain work 12 equals doing to six inches of rain.

43
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:52,130
And so on up to 90 Mike it doesn't take this 20 since this range will take only values from 10 to 20

44
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:53,980
mins what we just made.

45
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:58,320
So that's all about range function for

46
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,200
keep watching and.
