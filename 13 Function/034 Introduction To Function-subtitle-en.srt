Welcome to the Python tutorial today we're going to talk about a function in Python a function is a

2
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:13,360
block of code that is used to perform one task.

3
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:20,850
We can repeat the function many times and spit out requirement which means that we define a function

4
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:26,620
once and a user can use over and over again.

5
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,980
So is call a function in Python.

6
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:37,810
Now I'm going to explain to you how to use the function function in Python.

7
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:42,320
You do fine using the word B.

8
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:50,820
And after that keyword we write the name of the function with fantasies.

9
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:59,750
I tried the name of the function with it is after and Carlon to get inside the function.

10
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:11,650
And now I'm going to simply print a string which is hello and in the next line put it down.

11
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:16,920
I used to get out of the function when I hit enter.

12
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,910
You can see if it goes out of the function.

13
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:24,060
So here the new line is started.

14
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:29,260
So now I'm going to call the function to call the function.

15
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:39,570
We simply write the name of the function to know the name of the function followed by better places

16
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:43,790
and in parenthesis we can place any argument.

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:52,380
So here I don't put any argument and will simply call the function in then me.

18
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:59,330
The result is string which means that when we call that function this name the function is called.

19
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:03,350
And this is printed in output.

20
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:07,410
So these are all about the only way defining the function.
