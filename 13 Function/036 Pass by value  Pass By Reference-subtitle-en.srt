1
00:00:02,030 --> 00:00:08,840
This to do you we're going to discuss what is possible and what is passed by reference.

2
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:12,220
So let us start with a pass by value.

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:21,230
So when you pass of value what we are doing is that we get it a copy of that variable and passes to

4
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:22,640
the function.

5
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:29,810
Suppose we created a variable x that will do fine outside the function and when we passed the variable

6
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:35,670
x occurred to 5 inside the function then we are not passing the actual value.

7
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:39,170
We are only passing the operator value here.

8
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:44,820
I opened up can script and now I'm going to execute a simple example by passing.

9
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,770
Then you insert the function.

10
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,820
So for that be a booklet of function.

11
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:58,490
So here I put a keyword in creating a function and now and give the name of the function which is hello

12
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,630
and instead this parent is I'll.

13
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:10,940
But don't exit after that and put Conan to get inside this function and will simply print the value

14
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:11,970
of x.

15
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:15,100
After that it will be done this.

16
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,840
So here are funkiness completed.

17
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:23,460
And now we have to create a variable x which are positive inside this function.

18
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:27,430
So for that and put X equal to B.

19
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:34,730
And after the next line I'm going to simply call this function by using the name Heno and insert this

20
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:41,490
function and put the argument x which is BOCES in this function.

21
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:50,460
So when we execute this model forget trivial Tartine because Harry Potter is a valuable Tartine.

22
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:54,970
So what happens when you exit 45

23
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:04,300
Hedi we get the new result which is exactly two point five.

24
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:05,360
One more thing.

25
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:13,840
It will bring about a new X and then we'll see what happens.

26
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:17,710
So we get all these new leads and we just harden.

27
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:22,770
So now I'm going to explain you the boss may Velu in this function.

28
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:29,200
So here first we create a variable x 19 and we just bodged to our function.

29
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:29,800
Hello.

30
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:32,570
So any pass this video will actually do.

31
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:38,950
Tiding then what we are doing here is just passing the copy of this variable which is x.

32
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:48,610
So then we actually do 14 in the function then it will not reflect back here altered the function because

33
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,670
here we just only passing the copied value not the actual value.

34
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:58,510
But this is the method to passing the value into this function.

35
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:02,140
So these are all about a possible value.

36
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:10,000
Now let's move to the next topic which is the pass by reference when we pass something why it happens.

37
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:17,450
So what we are doing is parsing the object itself or we can say you passing the or isn't variable.

38
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:23,300
We are not copying the variable we just passed the variable in that function.

39
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:31,460
So any change in the object or variable in the function then those changes are reflected back to the

40
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:32,770
actual variable.

41
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:41,400
Now let us understand to a simple example here and could execute a simple example of pass by and I-phones.

42
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:46,110
So first we have to create a function using the key word B.

43
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:50,560
And after that I'll put the name of the function which is hello.

44
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:55,460
And instead the identity is kept up but excellent.

45
00:03:55,850 --> 00:04:04,160
And after that colon forget the function and I will simply print the value of variable x.

46
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,920
So had we done this function you don't keyword.

47
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:15,770
So this function is completed and after that the appropriate variable response inside the function.

48
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:22,060
So here I am going to create a variable in firstling which is the.

49
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:28,330
So here I created a list instead of variable.

50
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,460
So here we have 4 item in the list.

51
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:39,500
And these four items are boxed in so this function to bust the list.

52
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,170
Instead this function we have to call this function by that name.

53
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,570
Hello.

54
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:51,410
And here I put a two boxes in this function table and this model

55
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:57,160
so heavy get the result of this list.

56
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:00,080
So now I'm who next been you.

57
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:03,410
What is a pass by reference in this function.

58
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:08,870
Now I'm going to join the list inside this function here.

59
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:19,030
I put it in the X and instead the square Bechard album zero which is the index value of this list and

60
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:19,790
hit it.

61
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:25,350
And so here the list is updated by the index value of zero.

62
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:34,080
Well now I wonder simply print the updated list help me get the result updated.

63
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,560
You can see the index position as 0 is genius to you.

64
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:47,270
Now I'm going to simply print the value of list outside the function here.

65
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:53,780
So here we get the same result with which is outside the function.

66
00:05:53,920 --> 00:06:00,610
So there's no difference between the list inside the function and the outside the function because then

67
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:09,130
we passed the list in the function we just passed the actual list not the copied list then whenever

68
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:15,000
we change anything in the list that it will reflect back outside the function.

69
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:18,660
So these all about are passed by reference in a function.
