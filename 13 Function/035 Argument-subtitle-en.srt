1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:07,780
This to do it you we're going to discuss some argument which are used in function.

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,940
So the first argument is required argument.

3
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:19,230
These are the main boss to function of correct order which means that the number of argument in the

4
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:24,420
function call sort of matched exactly to the function definition.

5
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:30,750
So it is necessary to get the exact value in the function call and the function definition.

6
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,870
So let's understand this simple example here.

7
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,450
I'm going to create a function after that I'll explain you the required argument.

8
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,450
So for that if you use a keyboard.

9
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:51,190
Hello I'm going to simply print the string Hello world.

10
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:02,290
After that I'll simply tear down this function and outside the function to simply call this function

11
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:03,120
by me.

12
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,310
So we'll get the result.

13
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:08,560
Hello Will we get the result.

14
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,220
Hello world.

15
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,080
So where do you get it.

16
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:17,790
Why the argument inside this function like X and we did not pass anything inside this calling function.

17
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:25,700
Then we'll get the argument error so we can see quite the argument as it is shown.

18
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:31,270
So here I'm going to simply pass a variable x here.

19
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,340
I we learned this morning we'll get the.

20
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:37,720
Hello world we get the result.

21
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:45,400
X is not defined so for that we can define X equal to then we'll get there.

22
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:49,250
Hello world what is functioning correctly.

23
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:52,090
These are all about the quarte argument.

24
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:57,780
Insert the function the next argument is the key word argument.

25
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:00,010
It is related to a function call.

26
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,010
So then call the function.

27
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:06,570
We have to identify the argument by the bad name.

28
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:15,530
So let's understand from the example here Anglo-Dutch simply create a function named hello and instead

29
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,000
the parent has put x.

30
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:24,520
After that I will simply print the value of X let me call the function here.

31
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:30,660
I'm going to simply call the function by the name hello and insert the function and put 23.

32
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:35,640
So this tree is passed to the variable x and the X is printed.

33
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,000
So when you get there is an entity.

34
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:40,210
So what is a good argument.

35
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,590
This function.

36
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:47,330
So I think I already said when to call the function we have to identify this argument by that by and

37
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:48,630
with the name.

38
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,930
So I'll put X to and granted 3.

39
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:56,950
So this value of going to 3 is identified by the bet and we don't name x.

40
00:02:57,070 --> 00:03:00,470
So this gives you an argument so is all about.

41
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:02,950
Your argument in function.

42
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:06,600
The next argument is a default argument.

43
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:13,390
It is the argument that defines the value of value is not provided in the function.

44
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:16,760
So let's understand a simple example.

45
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:21,010
I'm going to get a simple function.

46
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,890
Hello is that the function.

47
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:26,230
Simply put X in the right loop.

48
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:33,970
After that it is simply print the value of x and y.

49
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:41,160
So I'll try the function to simply call this function by the name hello and insert the function will

50
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:44,990
give to them and we don't get 3 in the 45.

51
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:50,740
So within this month you will get the exact result which is 23 and 45.

52
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:52,930
So what does that do for an argument.

53
00:03:52,960 --> 00:04:01,120
So then we remove this value from the calling function and would insert the definition of the function.

54
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:09,010
So so what bystander's it will firstly copy the value guaranteed to insert this variable x.

55
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:11,890
So then within this model we will get the exact result.

56
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:14,010
We just don't want to fight.

57
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:17,190
So these are all about a default argument.

58
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:27,340
The next argument is the variable length argument these type of argument is used when we define the

59
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:34,960
function and we don't know how many argument we are going to parse in certain function which means that

60
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:41,780
the perimeter and the argument both of very As But our requirement.

61
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:44,720
So let us understand to a simple example.

62
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:51,040
First you have to create a function but that would be and name the function.

63
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,620
Hello.

64
00:04:52,030 --> 00:05:03,310
And instead the function parent is put to Mr X and then and before and I'll put a stick mark this denoted

65
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:07,480
that here you pass as many value.

66
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,660
Insert this.

67
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,500
Bette Midler.

68
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,720
So first you have to put in the belly of.

69
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:21,290
So as to return the function and simply call it function by using.

70
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:23,250
And here I put.

71
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:29,170
Well so this 12 is complete good this variable x and x is printed.

72
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,110
Hey we get this.

73
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:39,190
Well and now I'm going to give some different value and insert the function with attractive 4 4 5 and

74
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,470
6.

75
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:44,190
So here we have three values for this variable.

76
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:48,490
And so this TV news is stored in the variable.

77
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:56,550
And so I'm going to simply get the value from that and using a for loop for B.

78
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:09,510
And I would simply put in value be we this more to be able to get that IZARD Well and after that we

79
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,880
will prevent you from the variable x.

80
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:15,960
We just turned it for 6 and 45.

81
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:22,850
So here this variable lenth argument is two values and the variable length Bellamy is.

82
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:25,630
And we can pass different vendors.

83
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,650
Day 6 again.

84
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:33,730
Certainly 18N this on the values is taught instead is very well.

85
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:36,880
Because these a strict MA which do not.

86
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:42,420
The bill passes different values and many believe in this very well.

87
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:46,840
So these are all about a variable argument function.
