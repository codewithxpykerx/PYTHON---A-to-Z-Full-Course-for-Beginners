00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:02,850
Welcome to computer by do to do.

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:09,750
Today we are going to learn how to declare the classes and how to use the classes and objects.

3
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:16,820
So here I just open up our script and now I'm going to show you this index of class and we can say how

4
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:18,540
do the classes.

5
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:22,120
So here I just try to see it as class.

6
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:23,610
So the class is a key word.

7
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:29,590
So when we declare a function we use d s so that B F is a key word.

8
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,390
So Same here we have a class which is the class key word.

9
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:40,320
And after the keyword I just typed the name of the class which is a student.

10
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,750
So this woman is a name of the class.

11
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:47,350
So generally the name of the class is the standard form the capital letter.

12
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:55,270
So here I just write as in the typewriter after you just put a column to get in the class.

13
00:00:55,270 --> 00:01:01,960
So this is the way to declare our class as we already know that inside a class with eight attributes

14
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:10,820
and matters which means that we age some ingredients and the matters which are used to big the cake.

15
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:14,310
So in python we cannot declare a variable.

16
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:22,690
We have to write the variable inside a special method that is any method the init method used to initialize

17
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:24,570
a variable instantly.

18
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:30,920
So now I'm going to in place of it method we can call it constructor also.

19
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:36,440
So here I going to define a function which is in it with never a new school.

20
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,940
After that I'll put cells.

21
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:43,040
And after that I'll put color to get inserted in it matter.

22
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:48,920
So here are you self-taught Nim which is equal to Alex.

23
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:54,160
So here we just create a variable which is the name of the student.

24
00:01:54,170 --> 00:02:01,400
So now I'm going to play an object which used to call this all the matters so now I'm going to create

25
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:06,010
an object which is associated with the plus Asturian.

26
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:11,590
So here I just write as one after that and put equal to and after that equal to.

27
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:15,130
I just tried the name of the class which is a student.

28
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:20,540
So here you can see the S1 is the object of this student class.

29
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:25,400
So whatever we did inside the class it just goes to the S1.

30
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:32,120
So now here we just create a object S1 and now I'm going to print the name of this student which is

31
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:38,410
elex by using plain function print ESPERANDO name.

32
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:42,710
So now I'm going to run this model.

33
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:44,770
So here we get the result.

34
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:50,780
Alex So now I'm going to explain you what do the self here.

35
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,850
So self is all by we.

36
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:57,510
Or we can say the word that represent the class excelled.

37
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:03,640
So here I'm going to explain you with the object control-C.

38
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:10,710
Come on we here you can see we have to object which is S1 and S2.

39
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,220
So now I'm going to run this one again.

40
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,180
So here we get a result.

41
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,110
Alex and Alex two times.

42
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:26,430
So when we initialized variable which is the name itself which means that it will work with the current

43
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:27,530
object.

44
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:35,410
So when this object is used then as one is a for that and when this object used then it will look for

45
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:37,000
the s2.

46
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:44,370
So now I'm going to change this something like that which just as soon insert the cells.

47
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:48,060
I'm going to pass as one here.

48
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,110
Haven't read this MUNDIAL.

49
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,340
We get the result.

50
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,590
Self is not defined.

51
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,400
Sorry.

52
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:03,040
Here to write as one.

53
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,500
So here we get a result which is elex.

54
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:12,500
So here when we get a single object to the object it passes inside the method when we use a single object

55
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:18,650
and then we use our different different object which means that we have more than one object for a single

56
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:19,640
class.

57
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:25,370
Then we have to use our self keyword good or past the current object.

58
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:29,260
So selfie used to present the current object.

59
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,850
So as we know that every class has some action which is equal to method.

60
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:37,840
So now I'm going to create a method here.

61
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:51,050
So I just simply copied this word and put DTMF and now I'm going to call them in name the method which

62
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:51,990
is work.

63
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:58,290
So every students have some action equal to work which means that every student can walk around etc.

64
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:03,730
and said Here I just write self Hillsong

65
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:17,770
So here we just need all mattered in the class.

66
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:29,340
And now I'm going to in something which is my name is Alex.

67
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:31,140
So now I'm going to

68
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:43,630
call the method by using the object as standard work.

69
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:51,920
So now I'm going to run this more do you get those equal to is not defined so the split

70
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,140
hey we get the result which is equal to.

71
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,840
My name is Alex.

72
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:07,600
So this is the way to create a method in the class and this is the way to call this method using the

73
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:08,610
object.

74
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,950
And now I'm going to write here.

75
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:13,060
My name is

76
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:18,630
self-loading name.

77
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:25,790
So this safter name is a class variable which means that we can use this self-dual name anywhere in

78
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:26,950
this class

79
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:32,350
into this model.

80
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:34,620
We get a result my name is Alex.

81
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,870
Alex is a self-taught name.

82
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:48,580
So now let's move some other things which is self name and class story classes classes.

83
00:06:48,750 --> 00:07:03,070
I'm going to copy the second name of order and put through times reduce self-taught classes and Sellersburg

84
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:06,850
mean them here I just write

85
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:14,940
classes and Leam.

86
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,790
So when we got a name here I read the boss of class here it will refer to these certain classes and

87
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:23,960
the surfer name.

88
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:35,390
So now I'm going to write to name which is X razored and class which is from 12.

89
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:38,460
Somehow when we put this model

90
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:43,840
we don't get any error.

91
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:51,210
Now I'm going to kill this by using self-taught names.

92
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:52,320
Sorry.

93
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:56,910
We're putting these server names names.

94
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:02,390
Self-taught memes.

95
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,890
So we need this more do we get the word which is name is not defined.

96
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:12,880
So names are idioms here.

97
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:20,660
So here we get a result which is my name is X Y Z.

98
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:25,010
So x is in which is equal to the last names.

99
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:28,810
And here are just plain dumb classes.

100
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:34,200
Now we need this model we get the result.

101
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:37,770
My name is X wizard alecks and 12.

102
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:46,140
So here we can see when the boxes are available in the class then the constructor is incidentally was

103
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:49,780
to separate the name and the separate classes itself.

104
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:57,340
So this method begins that constructor is used to initialize dto then say double plus.

105
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:02,600
So this all the variables are used anywhere in this class.

106
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:07,410
It means that these are class variable not a stance variable.

107
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:09,830
So now let's change something here.

108
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:14,990
I'm going to create another object equal to as two

109
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:28,760
extra dog walk and here I'm to pass something which is white X Wizard and you start eating.

110
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:32,740
So here we have two different object inside the object.

111
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:36,080
We have four different venues just exquisite.

112
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:38,620
Well why is it in Italy.

113
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:46,180
So with this model this first object is passes through this initialiser which is named in classes by

114
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,620
exquisite control and the eclipsing W which is ex-president.

115
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,840
Well I mean we deal with the second object then white X's.

116
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:57,140
Responses to these names.

117
00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:06,020
And this it possible these classes to ascend with used to initialize are being assigned the object itself.

118
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:10,810
And now we get those are just equal to.

119
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:18,320
So here we get the result x x and y x Zed.

120
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:26,660
So we get a result different from the previous one because the two objects are used in two manners because

121
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,690
of the scent.

122
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:34,150
So then we use upthrust object the selfie refer to that and then we use a second object then central

123
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,720
deafer to this second object which is equal to as two.

124
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,900
So this is the way to use a cell.

125
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:45,010
And this is a way to create a class object and the method.

126
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,620
So that's all about the class as an object in Python.
