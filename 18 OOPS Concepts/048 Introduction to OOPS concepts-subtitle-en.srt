00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:07,510
Welcome to the 500 we're here today we are going to learn the concept of hoops in Python.

2
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:12,880
So what is the full from of boops with the object oriented programming and system.

3
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:19,540
So the entire concept is derived from the word we just classes and objects.

4
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,070
So what is a class and what is the object.

5
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:31,260
A class is a model which consists of matter and data an object is anything that really exists in the

6
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:31,800
world.

7
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:38,890
So let's take a simple example to understand the process and the objects.

8
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:45,850
Suppose there is a building inside the city so the building exists physically inside the world.

9
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:47,910
So the building is the object.

10
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,930
And now suppose you have a paper instead of paper.

11
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,140
There is a sketch of the building.

12
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:57,240
So the paper is a blueprint of that building.

13
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:04,390
So the paper is called the classes which means that the people considered all the models which is data

14
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:07,360
and method to build a building.

15
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:13,430
So this is the class of people and there is the object which is physically exist inside the world.

16
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:18,240
So now let's take another example to understand the class as an object.

17
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:24,580
So here we have two things in Lampron side we have a recipe to bake a cake.

18
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:28,210
And in the left hand side we have some cakes.

19
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,240
So as we know that a recipe is needed to bake a cake.

20
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:37,310
So this recipe is called a class and the gate is called the object.

21
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:44,370
So the main difference between the class and object here which is a kitchen but you can bet it is big.

22
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:50,720
It means that we actually exist in the world but we can't eat up a recipe.

23
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:58,720
So when we bake a cake which means that we create an object according to the class definition plus definition

24
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:04,000
means that ingredient and the method which exist in the recipe.

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:11,020
So here we go the list all the things with our class as an object to simply we have a class which is

26
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:13,880
a recipe and the object which is a cake.

27
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:20,680
So as I already said that class consists of the data and the method to insert the recipe.

28
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:26,860
We have some ingredients and after that we have some matters the ingredients are data and the metal

29
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:29,820
is a way to make the cake.

30
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:35,650
So when making something inside our glasses all we can say in that order is to be then the object will

31
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:36,970
also change.

32
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:39,910
So that's all about the glass as an object.

33
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:45,760
So now let's move to the other topic where we can see how to make the pluses and how to make the object

34
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:46,840
in Python.
