00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:07,210
Welcome to the party and to me today we're going to loan inheritance in Brighton.

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:14,660
Or we can say inheritance in the word inheritance means acquiring property from other sledged a good

3
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:15,410
example.

4
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:20,270
So here you can see there's a button and there's the sun.

5
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:28,120
So the sun is in some property from their parent which means that the parent is a base class and the

6
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,220
Son is derived class.

7
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:38,620
So when we did something inside of this class all we can say in class then the class can easily use

8
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:40,980
the property from the base class.

9
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:47,260
So the inheritance is used to acquire the property from the base class.

10
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:50,140
So there are two types of inheritance.

11
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:56,460
The first one is a single level inheritance and the second one is a multilevel inheritance.

12
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:03,640
So here you can see the child is inherited from a single base class which means that the base class

13
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:06,330
can be a father or mother.

14
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:13,550
So here we use a single level inheritance to acquire the property from the base class.

15
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:16,570
So now what is a multilevel inheritance.

16
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:25,190
Suppose we have a class which is our son and the Son is acquire a property from a base class which is

17
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,680
all father and mother.

18
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:31,650
So there is a base class which is father and mother.

19
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:37,980
So the son is acquired the property from the base classes which his father and mother.

20
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,830
This is called multi-role inheritance.

21
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:46,300
Now let's take a simple example to understand in doesn't bite.

22
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:51,770
So here I just opened up iTunes script and now I'm going to implement a simple example.

23
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:56,240
So here you have to write applause which is a key word.

24
00:01:56,470 --> 00:02:04,720
And after that I like that even the clouds with you father after the input column and get inside the

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,900
glass.

26
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:11,770
And now I'm redefining of method which is last name

27
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:23,020
and instead the president says I'm the boss of cells.

28
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:26,230
I'm going to print W which is

29
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,740
my surname.

30
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:42,980
So here we have a betting class but we get a base class inside the base class we have a method which

31
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,960
is a last name.

32
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:49,030
Now I'm going to create a child class or we can say or B I love.

33
00:02:49,230 --> 00:03:00,880
So here I will ride class or the alphabet alerts son that's for him and I'm going to declare a method

34
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:03,720
a B which is first name

35
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:16,370
ends are good but intensives put sealed up there and put color good in the method.

36
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:27,450
And now I'm going to simply bring the values of the concept string with just my first name.

37
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:33,320
So here you can see the read in class and after that there is a class.

38
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:40,910
So now how Pitre knows this is a draft class and this is very close to forbad you have to write the

39
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:48,530
name of the class from where you want to acquire the properties or reconsider but in class so far there

40
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:50,440
is a better class.

41
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:54,080
So here we have a class which is equal to father.

42
00:03:54,120 --> 00:04:06,090
Now I'm going to an object because as one after the elder son and now I'm going to call the method which

43
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:10,220
is first name.

44
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:19,970
So here we just call the method which is partner from the sun or begins the second class.

45
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:23,520
Now when we do this more do we get the result.

46
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:25,260
My first inning.

47
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:30,660
So now I'm going to acquire the property which is the last name.

48
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,100
So here I just tried

49
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:48,470
one Dorte last name so when it is more do we get the result which is equal to my first name and surname.

50
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:52,750
So this my first name is coming from the charted class.

51
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:56,200
And this Sunday was coming from the class.

52
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:59,100
So this is the way to create a better class.

53
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:04,290
And the same class is called a single inheritance.

54
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:11,060
And now I'm going to get another glass to show the multilevel inheritance.

55
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:11,800
I just tried

56
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:20,730
a heavy heavy another class which is mother.

57
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:25,470
So have you ever take classes with his father mother and son.

58
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:29,140
So we have a two parent class which is father and mother.

59
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:36,830
So here I just write my surname to and now I'm going to do it again.

60
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:42,720
We get that Israel would just my first name and the son and now I'm going to edit something and said

61
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,040
oh so close.

62
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:47,660
And now I'm going to pass the mother class inside.

63
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:51,130
So close by using the name of the class.

64
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:55,970
So here I just like two classes which is a base class.

65
00:05:55,970 --> 00:06:10,020
And now I'm going to simply write as one dark last name or thing or thing which is I think I picked

66
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:14,380
the name of the method which is last name ONE LAST NAME ONE.

67
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:18,890
So here read it and this Madill we get the results.

68
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:21,310
That is my surname too.

69
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:28,300
So you can see these results are coming from the base classes which is from father.

70
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,230
And this is from mother.

71
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:34,680
So this is a way to create a modular inheritance in Brighton.

72
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:45,530
You can add many things like when I copy and paste mother Sardi

73
00:06:49,160 --> 00:07:00,670
grandmother pasta's base close to the class and third strike three.

74
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:10,260
And here I just start to hear and now I'm going to simply call this method by using the child class.

75
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:20,220
Well just last name to run it on is more do to good reason which is my son 3.

76
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:26,710
So these these are open from the base class and this first one is coming from the child class.

77
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,890
So these are all about in head heddes in Python.
